# Races
There are a vast number of races, though, only a few are playable. Non-playable races can be found [here](NOLINK). These races are listed in order of population, with the exception of the Avarians, who insisted they be listed first.

### Ariveros
The Ariveros are a proud race, and the most technologically advanced. They are the founders and rulers of a vast empire, the Averian Empire. It is within this empire that our story takes place.
All information for making an Ariverian character can be found on their page: [Ariverian Characters](NOLINK). 

It should be noted that making a character of the Avarian race requires making the character's class the Avarian    class. In other words, the race and class are combined.

### Humans
Humans are the prolific race who posess great inginuity and intellect for such a short-lived species. There are no changes to Humans from the PHB.

### Telwar
The Telwar are a strange race, with dark skin and strange hollow structures on their heads. They posess no hair whatsoever, and do not have what can be called ears. However, the hollow structures on the back and sides of their heads function in much the same way, but at a more precise level, giving them very keen hearing. This is a key survival attribute from their homeworld, nearly entirely covered in thick jungle, and full of predators. 

For player statistics, use the stats of elves (any variety) with these changes: 
 * Fey Ancestory is removed. In its place, you gain: 
 
    **Home among the Trees:** you have a climbing speed equal to half your walking speed.
 * Trance is removed. In its place, you gain:
 
    **Alert:** It is harder to surprise you. When you are surpried, roll a d20. If the roll is less than or equal to your player level, you are not surpried.


### Crantiel
The Crantiel are a race that make many people uncomfortable. Their entire body is covered in a short, soft fur, and they don't grow hair longer than a centemeter. They are extremely sensetive to light, being able to see in pitch black conditions. They come from a planet where the entire population lives in extensive cave networks under the surface, as the planet is bombarded by strong UV radiation that kills anything on the surface, except for the mushrooms. And those practically make up the survace, their mycelium extending miles under the surface, and forming the basis of the Crantiel construction.

For player statistics, they are Tabaxi, with a single change: the range of their darkvision is doubled.


### Gruudfa
The Gruudfa are large, horny creatures, with slow and simple speech, but incredibly skilled at craftsmanship. They have no hair, instead, their skin is covered in scales made from keratin. (The same material as fingernails and hair) Their culture has many heavy songs, many wars, and many craftsmen. It is hard for non-Gruudfa to distinguish the sexes in this race, as both are similar in appearance.

For player staticstics, they are similar to Dwarves, with these changes:
 * Size changes, to be between 6 and 8 feet tall. Medium size.
 * Speed is 30 ft, and is not reduced below 25 ft by armor.
 * The Stonecutting ability also applies to works of metal.
