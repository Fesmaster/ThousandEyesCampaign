## Money
Money is entirely in the form of *credits*. A credit is worth about a silver piece. All money is actually a form of crytocurrency, and is kept on the creature's datapad. This makes looting money off of dead enemies difficult, but not impossible, if they have a datapad you can take. Credits are sometimes kept on special "Credit Chips", a type of card used to store them in a more stable state. Credits on a credit chip cannot be directly spent, but have to be trasfered to the Datapad. If a creature has a credit chip, they can put more credits on it from their Datapad. Enemies defeated that have credit chips can have this item looted, and the credits on it taken by the players too.

## The Datapad
Most players will have a datapad. This is a sort of mobile computational device, a turing-complete electrocuronic machine. It has many internal sensors, and many applications with various purposes. It is used for communications, navigation, analytics, data lookup, and entertainment. 

The look and style of a datapad depends on what the purpose of one is. Common ones are mostly made of transparent crystal, with a bottom edge of metal. More industrial or scientific ones generally have more metal, and are larger.

## Armor
This table details the general types of armor most commonly available, however, other types can also be found or purchased. Further, each particular type is a generalization of specific armors made by various companies, and having various other features or drawbacks.

|                       |           |                       |               |           |
|*Heavy armor*          |           |                       |               |           |
|ACM Combat Armor       |1200 C     |15                     |13             |20 lbs     |
|┗━ACM Combat Tasset    |800 C      |AC+2                   |+2             |+10 lbs    |

|                       |           |                       |               |           |

Some armors are designed to be used as a set. This is indicated in the above table by the indents. When worn as a set, the final AC is calculated using the table above. For example, wearing a Light Torso Vest and Light Helmet will give an AC of 13+1+DEX(max 2), or, 14-16, depending on DEX. However, when worn in combinations that are not part of the same set, a penalty of -1 AC for each mismatch is applied. So, if you wear the Light Torso Vest with the Heavy helmet, you get an AC of 13+2+DEX(max 2) - 1(penalty) for a total of 14-16 (no improvement). If Advanced Optics were added, it would make it even worse, 13+2+1+DEX(max 2) = 3(penalty, 3 mismatches), or 13-15, which is less than without the Optics. 


## Weapons
Like armor, there are a wild variety of weapons, and thus only the general types are listed here. The exact models that can be found or purchased are often slightly different. More information about the types of weapons and the models available is incoming. It should also be noted that all weapon types from the PHB are valid, though not necessarily made in the same manner or with the same materials as they would be in medieval times.

### Special Weapon Properties
Firearms in particular have several properties that they use that are not in the PHB. These are listed here.

**Automatic.** Automatic weapons fire multiple rounds. Replacing to making a regular attack, automatic weapons can instead perform a linear AoE attack, forcing a DEX save dc 10+the attack modifer (ie, the attacker's DEX of +2 and a Proficency of +3 would make the DEX save a DC 15 (10+2+3)). Automatic weapons can also be switched to single shot mode for more accurate firing.

**Burst.** Burst shot weapons fire three rounds. Attacks made with burst fire weapons gain advantage against their target, only if the target does not have cover. However, if the attack misses, the closest ally within 5 feet of the line of fire is hit instead. Burst weapons can also be switched to single-shot mode, for more accurate firing, removing both the benifit and drawback of burst firing.

**Scope** Scope weapons are able to have a scope attached onto them to increase their accuracy. While it is true that most weapons can have a scope taped to them, or even mounted on custom brackets, not all weapons benefit from this. The exact benefit of the scope that is attached is determined by the model of scope and the DEX score of the creature using the weapon. These weapons do not come with a scope built in.
