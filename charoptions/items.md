## Money
Money is entirely in the form of *credits*. A credit is worth about a silver piece. All money is actually a form of crytocurrency, and is kept on the creature's datapad. This makes looting money off of dead enemies difficult, but not impossible, if they have a datapad you can take. Credits are sometimes kept on special "Credit Chips", a type of card used to store them in a more stable state. Credits on a credit chip cannot be directly spent, but have to be trasfered to the Datapad. If a creature has a credit chip, they can put more credits on it from their Datapad. Enemies defeated that have credit chips can have this item looted, and the credits on it taken by the players too.

## The Datapad
Most players will have a datapad. This is a sort of mobile computational device, a turing-complete electrocuronic machine. It has many internal sensors, and many applications with various purposes. It is used for communications, navigation, analytics, data lookup, and entertainment. 

The look and style of a datapad depends on what the purpose of one is. Common ones are mostly made of transparent crystal, with a bottom edge of metal. More industrial or scientific ones generally have more metal, and are larger.

Some armors are designed to be used as a set. This is indicated in the above table by the indents. When worn as a set, the final AC is calculated using the table above. For example, wearing a Light Torso Vest and Light Helmet will give an AC of 13+1+DEX(max 2), or, 14-16, depending on DEX. However, when worn in combinations that are not part of the same set, a penalty of -1 AC for each mismatch is applied. So, if you wear the Light Torso Vest with the Heavy helmet, you get an AC of 13+2+DEX(max 2) - 1(penalty) for a total of 14-16 (no improvement). If Advanced Optics were added, it would make it even worse, 13+2+1+DEX(max 2) = 3(penalty, 3 mismatches), or 13-15, which is less than without the Optics.
