# Runestones

## The General Idea

The general idea of runestones is that they are a stone, a rock, that supports a magical rune, for instantaneous or continuous magical effects. 
The requirements for making a runestone differ with what the intended rune / effect is. Instantaneous runes do not need any special stone, however, runes that make a continuous effect do. 


## Types of Runes

Runes can do many things. 

It is possible to store any spell (for its normal duration) in an “instantaneous” runestone, by carving that stone and casting the spell at that time. No extra work. The drawback is that doing so requires passing a DC check with the character’s spellcasting ability, as detailed in the Making Runestones section. The player must know the spell and have a spell slot of that level. The spell slot is consumed even if the runestone carving fails.

Another common use is to increase an ability score, or give proficiency to a specific skill / saving throw. This is always considered a continuous effect, and the stone used must have some inherent magic. 

A third use is to do something the player imagines, and describes to the DM. the DM then can decide what checks need to be made, as well as what is consumed when making the stone (ie, if it is a continuous effect or an instantaneous effect) 


## Identifying a Runestone

Any runestone found in the wild (except Marmori-made runestones) can be easily identified with a DC 15 Arcana check. Alternatively, the runestone can be used to release its magic, if it is instantaneous. If it is continuous, it takes 24 hours in physical contact to identify it. 


## Runestone sizes

Runestones can come in all shapes and sizes. In general, they need a minimum of 1 sq. centimeter to carve the rune on, though this does not have to be flat, just smooth (ie, it can be the curved surface of a bead) Some runestones can be significantly larger, being several inches across or long. However, these runestones can still only have one rune.

There are runestones large enough for multiple runes, but they must have at least 1 sq. foot of surface on which to carve the runes. The number of runes supported depends directly on the surface area, each rune taking up an area 6 inches on each side. There is an accumulated +5 to the DC mentioned below when adding runes to a large, multirune runestone. These runestones are generally standing stones or other permanent structures. 


## Making a Runestone

The prerequisites to crafting a runestone are one of: Being able to cast spells, or, the Runecrafting feat.

To make a runestone successfully, the player must pass a check using their spellcasting ability modifier (making a runestone requires the ability to cast spells). The DC for any runestone starts at 10, but changes according to this table:

| Modification                                                                                                                | DC change    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Spell Emended Level (including at higher level):                                                                            | +spell level |
| Stone is common type                                                                                                        | +2           |
| Stone is rare type                                                                                                          | -2           |
| Stone is a gemstone, larger an 1 cu centimeter                                                                              | -5           |
| Stone is soft (limestone, sandstone)                                                                                        | +3           |
| Stone is hard (granite)                                                                                                     | -3           |
| Stone has detectable magic aura                                                                                             | -2           |
| Stone has emotional connection to carver                                                                                    | -1           |
| Stone originates from a source in opposition to the effect (ie, using a stone from a fire elemental’s body to do ice magic) | +3           |
| Stone originates from a source in line with the effect (ie, using a stone from a fire elemental’s body to do fire magic)    | -3           |

Further, the DC increases by 1 for every runestone previously attempted that  day.

If the player succeeds on this check, then they are able to make the runestone. (assuming all other conditions are met)
They do also, however, need the right kind of stone. An inherently magical stone is necessary for a continuous effect runestone, an arcana check with DC 17 can tell if a stone is inherently magical, or Detect Magic can do the same. If a  nonmagical stone is attempted to be used when creating a continuous runestone, the stone is likely to harmlessly explode into sand or just crack in half. 

If inscribing a spell, they must know the spell and have the appropriate slot (or number of slots). The slot(s) are consumed on both success and failure. They can choose to use a higher level slot / more slots for a greater power, as the spell’s ruling goes, however, this also increases the DC.

If using a custom effect, the DM may describe certain knowledge the player must obtain before crafting the runestone, and other that might lower the DC. They may also prescribe a spell slot cost associated with crafting the runestone, particularly if it is an instantaneous effect stone. 


### Changes By Species

Some species are different with different runestones.

Avarian
This whole thing does not apply to Avarians, they have their own special cantrips instead.

Humans
Do not accumulate the DC +1 for each successive attempt in a day.

Tiefling, Fallen Aasamar
Can also make a runestone on bone. Similar changes to DC required, with an overall +1.  Runes related to necrotic purposes gain a -1 to the DC.

Non-fallen Aasamar
Can also make a runestone on metal or glass. Similar changes to DC required, with an overall +1. Runes related to celestial magic gain a -1 to the DC. 

Genasi
Runestones related to their element are easier to make, a -3 to the DC. Stones from sources related to their element are also easier to use, with a -2 to the DC. These two stack with each other and the already related element and stone source. (see table) 

Telwar
Can also make a runestone on wood. Similar changes to DC required, with an overall +1.  Runes related to nature magic gain a -1 to their DC.

Gnomes
-4 to the crafting DC. Also, can use Intelligence even if its not their spellcasting modifier. 

Marmori
Runes are indecipherable to other species, as they are more about the emotions the individual had while carving it than a written language. Also, two runestones of the same effect would look different, unlike other species. Runestones related to water have a -2 to the DC. 

Crantiel, Gruudfa, Halflings, Firbolgs and Goliaths
Probably changes, I just don’t care to come up with this yet.


### Runecrafting feat

The Runecrafting feat allows you to collect spells in a spellbook, like a wizard, and use them to craft runestones. You cannot cast these spells as a result of the feat.
