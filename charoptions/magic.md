# Magic

Magic traditionally is a bit of a tricky system, filled with rules that seem to hamper creativity. This is not to say that there is none, but some of the structure of the rules limits it. These tweaks to the traditional rules of magic (or, more accurately, and entire reworking of them) aim to change that.

## Spell Slots and Spell Levels
Instead of having a tiered list of spell slots, this system only has one tier, but spells consume different numbers of slots. To convert a character from the traditional system, their total slots is equal to the sum of the number of slots of that level times the level itself for all the traditional spell slot levels. This means that if a character has three first-level traditional slots and two second level, they have `(3*1) + (2*2) = 7` of the new slots. Likewise, a 20th level Wizard will have `(4*1) + (3*2) + (3*3) + (3*4) + (3*5) + (2*6) + (2*7) + (1*8) + (1*9) = 89` of the new spell slots.

To pair with this, the spell slot levels must be removed from the spells themselves. The simplest way to do this is that they each consume the number of slots that that spell's previous level was. In other words, a first-level spell consumes one spell slot, a  fifth-level consumes five, and a nineth-level consumes nine. Casting spells at higher levels just comsumes more slots. Thus, casting a 2nd level spell at 5th level just means that the spell consumes 5 slots.

As for learning spells, the ideas are the same. If the PHB chart says that a character has at highest third level slots, they can learn up to and including third level spells, even though they have many more slots than normal.

This actually allows spells of any particular level to be cast more times than normal. In other words, a 20th level wizard can cast a 9th level spell many more times (about nine times, actually), or can cast Magic Missile almost 90 times, the actual number of spells that can be cast total, with a spread over all the levels, is about the same, depending on the play style. This does open whole new styles, such as a magic user who can cast low-level spells basically forever, or an overpowered caster who can cast a high-level spell a few more times than normal, but is then done for the day

It should be noted that cantrips are completely unmodified.

## Spell Modification

Magic is as much an art form as it is a Science. And in both, you can tweak things, change them slightly, for different effects. So why not the same with Magic? The idea here is that players need a good set of rules for customizing a spell. Of course, all modifications should be discussed with the DM, who may have a logical reason that the modification might not work. (such a reason is likely to maintain the balance of play, such as preventing a modification that would allow for easy instant-kills)

### Spell Count
So, you have modified a spell (how to do that follows). What happens? Does it just appear in your spell list? If you are a class with an unlimited number of spells, like a wizard, then yes! it does. However, if you are more limited in your number of known spells, like a Cleric, then it replaces the spell modified to get it. You can always restore it to its original state later (for free) so keep track of what it was.

### Damage and Healing Changes 
For damage changes, there are three things that could be changed: the actual damage die (count and/or type), the number of targets, and the damage element. Changing the element does not incur a change in the spell's level, and is effectively a simple swap. More corporeal damage types (such as piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning) need a good explanation from the player though. The caviat is that healing spells cannot be modified to deal damage, or vice versa.

Changing the amount of damage or healing, or the number of targets (being single target or multi-target), will likely change the spell level. This is an easy way to level up a bad, lower level spell to a higher level one. A spell's level is based off of how much damage it does, relative to the number of targets. Use the following chart to determine the level, matching the damage die being used, (min, max, average rolls) to the level for the appropriate target count. Damage is given as `Xd10 [Min, Average, Max]`. 

|Spell Level|One Target			|Many Targets	|
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1			|2d10  [2,11,20]	|2d6  [2,7,12]	|
| 2			|3d10  [3,16,30]	|4d6  [4,14,24]	|
| 3			|5d10  [5,27,50]	|6d6  [6,21,36]	|
| 4			|6d10  [6,33,60]	|7d6  [7,24,42]	|
| 5			|8d10  [8,44,80]	|8d6  [8,28,48]	|
| 6			|10d10 [10,55,100]	|11d6 [11,38,66]|
| 7			|11d10 [11,60,110]	|12d6 [12,42,72]|
| 8			|12d10 [12,66,120]	|13d6 [13,45,78]|
| 9			|15d10 [15,82,150]	|14d6 [14,49,84]|

If done cleverly, this method could take an under-performing spell and tweak it without changing the level though, to make it stronger. An example of this is taking a spell that does 3d6 damage (3-18, average of 10) and replace the damage die with 5d4, with gives 5-20 damage, with 12 on average. Both would qualify as a level one spell (against a single target) but the second damage die is actually much stronger and more reliable.

### Duration and Area
Changing the duration and area of a spell effect could change the spell's level if large enough. For example, the classic spell, *Fireball* by default has a 20-ft radius explosion. (range of 150 ft). Dramatically altering either of these (such as doubling the radius) would increase the spell level. Here, it is up to the DM to determine if it does, and by how much. It could also be used to bring down the level of a spell, by, in this example, decreasing the range to 75 ft. 

This principle also applies to the duration of a spell. An example, with the spell *Enthrall*, has a duration of 1 minute. Increasing that to 5 minutes would increase the spell level, or, decreasing it to 1 round would decrease the spell level.

### More complex changes
Since many spells are effectively specific rules related to the event of its casting, many spells do not nicely fit into this format. This does not mean that they cannot be modified, just that any proposed modifications will need to be discussed throughly with the DM, who will determine any spell level changes, or, in more extreme cases, if that modification is possible.

### How to Modify a Spell
Now that the mecanics of modification have been discussed, it is important to know the actual actions the character will have to take to modify a spell. The first thing is the character must actually know the spell they wish to modify. Next, they will need to spend the requisite credits (if not using credits, 1/10 the number in Gold Pieces) to modify it. Any modification starts at 500 credits, and gains 200 for each level change involved. (thus, taking a 2nd level spell and weakening it to first level costs 700 credits). This cost is for materials needed to perform the experiments for the modification. Finally, modifying a spell takes a full day's time (12 hours). This time can be spread out over several days, or done all at once. Of course, the DM may make an additional requirement for any proposed modification, such as a rare component needed for the experiments.
