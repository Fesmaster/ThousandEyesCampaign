# Class Changes
A few classes have major changes, and many have minor changes. The majority of this is lore.

### Barbarian
Barbarians in this world are more rare than in others, often hailing from underdeveloped settlement worlds. They may not know how to pilot any vehicles, and often prefer melee weapons over long-range firearms.

### Bards
Bards are not changed much, but it should be noted that they are less common on planets with a high Avarian population, and the Avarians are not given to musical friviolities in the same way as other races. They prefer "higher quality" music than the bard's "street performances".

### Clerics
Since the Celestials ("gods") are not capable of traveling planet to planet, having a cleric that is devoted to one in particular makes that cleric powerless on a planet where that Celestial is not present. Thus, most clerics are devoted to an ideal, a particular virtue, and receive patronage from that virtue's patron Celestial wherever they may be. 

### Druid
Druid's connection to nature leads them to usually be from one of two places: Underdeveloped settlement worlds, and worlds that have high agricultural usage. Though some also come from gardeners and tenders of parks and reserves on more densly populated worlds.

### Fighter
Fighters are fighers, no two ways to cut it. However, tey are more likely to be skilled in using firearms.
With that in mind, here are several new Fighting Styles:
 * **Artillerist** you are skilled with heavy cannons, automatic turrets, and other large firearms. When such weapons are present and connected to a single system, you can fire all of them at once. Examples include a pair of turrets on a armored vehicle or a battery of heavy cannons. Each weapon makes its own attack and damage roll.
 * **Sniper** You can accurately shoot ranged weapons to their full distance without having disadvantage, and shoot double that with disadvantage.
 * **Battleblaster** A master of firearm combat, you gain a +2 to all damage rolls with ranged weapons.
 * **Steady Shooter** (Rename of Archer) You gain a +2 to attack rolls made with ranged weapons.

### Monk
Monks are mostly unchanged, but, several weapons have been added as monk weapons.
 * Pistols
 * ?
 * Bora Rifle-Staves

### Paladin
Like clerics, it is better for Paladins to be devoted to a particular virtue, instead of a particular Celestial. This is again a lore change, rather than mechanics. 

### Rangers
Rangers definately come from underdeveloped worlds, often being part of the first settlement efforts. They have proficency in all types of firearms.

### Rogue
Rogues are mostly unchanged, and they often hail from the most densly populated planets, where crime is common, and commonly caught!

### Sorcerer
These powerful magic users are uncommon, and usually result from someone being exposed to powerful curonic energies, or some lineage of that. They have some sort of inbuild ability to effect Curons in a way no other people have naturally.

### Warlock
Warlocks are very uncommon. With the advancement of science, the need to make deals with otherworldly beings to gain knowledge decreased. The warlock class is not recomended, and any character in it would have to be heavily customized. 

### Wizard
Wizards are significantly more common. Magic (or, as they call it, Curonics) is the sort of thing that almost all students at university study a little, taking classes like "Into to the Curonics" (CURN 100) or "Curon Logic" (CURN 134). Curonics (Magic) is a phenonemon that is well studied and explained by science, indeed, it is simply seen as a particular and specific branch of science. Thus, wizards are called Curonists, and the practice, Curonics. While other classes utilize it, none study it and master it. Like how most people can wire up a battery to an LED, almost anybody knows the basics, but if you want somthing awesome and detailed like a seven-mode flashlight that is also a bluetooth speaker and contains a hidden tazer, you need a specalists understanding.

### Artificer
Like Wizards, Artificers work closely with Curonics (Magic). They are more the industrical, practical electricians of Curonics, rather than the researcher, but still skilled and knowledgeable.
