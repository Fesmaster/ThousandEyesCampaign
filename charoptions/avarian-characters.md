Cresting the hill, Garloc saw somthing he would never forget. Nearly three hundred feet long, the massive metal structure sat in a pit dug to fit it. Thousands of small figgures swarmed over the scaffolding, putting the finishing touches on the structure's repair.

A few hours later, the area was finally clear, and the structure began to humm. Then, without warning, it began to hover. It was a ship. The stories were true. The Avarians could fly. Not on wings, but in massive metal buildings. And yet, even they were foolish. No one had ever defeated his tribe. Not even these mysterious "Grenier" that they claimed were coming. His tribe could defend itself.

Only days later, the Grenier arrived. Garloc and his tribe were wiped out from orbit, never even seeing the face of the enemy. But his planet was not conquored. The warship he had seen was only part of a larger fleet, which drove the invaders back, and many of Garloc's people were saved.

## The Race

### Pride and Sacrifice
The Avarians are a old race, though greatly flawed. They are known for being prideful to a fault, believing that only they are fit to protect the less advanced races that they have come into contact with. They consider themselves to be the best, though, it is no fault of others that they are not. But in the end, they are self-giving. Because they are the best, when someone must put their life on the line, it should be an Avarian. 

### Memories of the Past
The Avarians have genetic memories, allowing them limited access to the memories of their ancestors. In effect, it is like trying to recall distant memories of childhood, but even further back. Information, however, is easier. The intuitive knowledge that a young girl's grandfather had about microbiology? She has it all. The long laundry list of poetry and song memorized by a musician seven generations ago? She can sing or recite every one. And yet, these do not define her. She is the one who wants to become the greatest chef ever, even though she is the first in her family to have this desire.

### Magic and Science
The world, to an Avarian, is a great sandbox, open to reshaping if you want to spend the time and the effort. Magic is just another aspect of science, a dangerous, hard-to-predict aspect to be sure, but mathematical and formulaic all the same. But who wants to do things quickly? It is better to do them slowly, a little at a time. Magic should be done in the smallest of amounts, not great flashy things like what Humans and Telwar do.

### Avarian Names
Family Names are important to the Avarians, as one's lineage can be a great source of information and knowledge. 

### Avarian Traits
 * **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligince Score increases by 2, and your Wisdom Score increases by 1.
 * **Age.** The Ariveros reach maturity by age 20, and live to be about 180 years old.
 * **Aligment.** The Ariveros value order, the principles of society and life. This does not conflict with freedom, and a good set of rules allows for more freedom than no rules whatsoever. More often than not, they are good, though, this is not a rule. Some of the worst tyrants have come from their ranks.
 * **Size.** As an Avarian, you stand somewhere around 5 to 6 feet, or possibly a little outside of this range. Your size is medium.
 * **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.
 * **Genetic Memory** Due to carrying the memories of all your ancestors, you have advantage on all history checks. You also have a significant body of knowledge on many topics, much of which the DM will tell you when it comes up.
 * **Imperial Citizenship** As an Avarian, you are a full citizen of the empire, meaning you do not have to pay for any public services, including public transportation, communications network access, and other services. However, you are required to spend several years working in a public office in the Empire, or in the military. 
 * **Languages** You know Common, as it is the language of your people. You also know two other languages of your choice. (Except the secret language of the Telwar.)
All Proficiencies are handled by the class.

### Creating an Avarian
Avarian children spend the first 20 or so years of life gaining their own experiences, their own learning, discovering who they are. While most are happy to go and settle down after this, often getting a job before working in public office, or perhaps joining the military, an adventurous few set out on their own. They will often fulfill their civil duties in unique ways, becoming the marshal of a colony, or working on an Imperial Exploration Vessel, or becoming the liaison for a group on non-Avarian contractors.

#### Quick build
You can make an Avarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score into Intelligence, for the highest spellcasting modifier you can get. Then, the next two highest should go to Dexterity and Constitution, allowing your character to be fast and have high health.

### Class Features
As an Avarian, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
 * **Hit Die:** 1d8 per Avarian level.
 * **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier.
 * **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Avarian level after 1st.

#### Proficiencies
 * **Armor:** Light armor
 * **Weapons:** Forceblades and Pistols
 * **Tools:** Tinkerer's Tools and three other types of Artisan's Tools of your choice.
 * **Saving Throws:** Intelligence and Dexterity
 * **Skills:** Choose four from: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, and Engineering.
 
#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background.
 * (a) A Mechanic's Pack or (b) a Scolar's Pack
 * (a) A forceknife or (a) a Spellshot Pistol
 * (a) A rangefinder or (b) Nightvision equipment.
 * A weak personal shield, Tinkerer's Tools and Assorted curonic circuit components.

### Cantrip Casting
As an Avarian, you have the ability to cast cantrips. See PHB ch 10 for general rules of spellcasting, and the end of this page for the Avarian spell list. 

Avarians cannot cast any spells higher in level than cantrips, however, there is no limit to the number of cantrips that they can learn and have memorized. All of your cantrips are consistantly ready and prepared to be cast, and there is no limit to the number of times that they can be cast per day. At first level, you have five cantrips that you know, and you gain two every time you level up. You can also learn a cantrip after about an hour studying with someone who knows it, or, a day learning it from writing. 

#### Spellcasting Ability
Your spellcasting ability is Intelligence. You use Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. This also determines your Spell Save DC and tour Spell Attack Modifier.

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

**Spell Attack Modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use many different types of items as your casting focus, from a standard Arcane Focus, or your tools, or some sort of family memento. 

### Supercharged Magic
At 2nd level, you have learned to manipulate the curon field (Weave of Magic for pleb wizards) to enhance a magical effect. You can do this to cantrips you cast, or, as a reaction cantrips and spells cast by others and the magic effects of magic items. To do so, you must spend a supercharge point. There are three possible effects:
1) If the spell has a duration equal to or greater than 1 minute, you can extend it up to twice its natural duration, with a maximum value of 24 hours.
2) If the spell requires an attack roll, you can add a 1d4 to that attack roll.
3) If the spell requires a saving throw, you can increase the DC of the saving throw by 1d4.

For the second and third option, the die used increases to d6 at 7th level, and to a d8 at 15th level.

### Sublcass
At 3rd level, you choose a subclass. All the subclasses are detailed later on this page. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, 14th, and 18th levels.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choosing bu 2 or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.


### Magical Manipulations
At 10th level, you have learned to manipulate the nature of magical effects around you by manipulateing the curon field. You can expend two Supercharge Points to change the damage type of a cantrip you cast, or, as a reaction, spells cast by others or effects of magical artifacts. If the caster is not friendly, you must suceed on a Intelligence check against their spell save DC for your manipulations to have any effect. 

However, the damage types Piercing, Slashing, and Bludgeoning cannot be chosen, as they are more representative of damage from a tactile source rather than from a magical source.

## Subclass
Different Averians specialize in different areas. Those are listed here.

### Greasemonkey
The Greasemonkey is a mechanic of impressive skill. They can fix anything, or build anything. 

#### Crittermaster
When you choose the Greasemonkey subclass at 3rd level, you know many tricks allowing you to make a small anamatronic animal, able to act and move as if they were a living animal. Theis anamatronic animal becomes companions and friends. 

It takes two hours to make a basic anamatronic, which can move around, but does not act intelligently. Another day to a week of work allows it to be indistinguishable in behavior from the real animal. 

Once constructed, you can choose to use your datapad to see what the creature sees and hear what it hears, and remote pilot it, at a distance up to 500 ft.

#### Vehicle Proficiencies
When you choose the Greasemonkey sublcass at 3rd level, your experience with various vehicles allows you to pilot them to a degree of proficiency. You gain proficency with all kinds of vehicles, including land, sea, and space vehicles.

#### Well-Equipped.
At 6th level, your mastery of tools allows you to know what tools you need, and have ones that are easily modified for new jobs. Your Tinkerer's Tools can be used to make checks for all types of Artisan's Tools.

#### On-The-Fly Engineering
At 11th level, you have the experience to build mechanical and technological contraptions quickly, improvising parts, in significantly less time than normal. You can quickly build a machine with a size up to large to perform any action that the DM considers logical. Examples include a small catapult, a portable missile, a trap, or even a small turret. The DM may require some parts to be needed, but most can be scavenged from things you have in your pockets or are in the area. Doing so takes one turn for each size (a Tiny machiene can be built in one turn, a Small machiene in two turns, and a Medium machine in three turns)

At 18th level, the maximum size is increased to a Large machine. Building a Large machiene takes four turns.
