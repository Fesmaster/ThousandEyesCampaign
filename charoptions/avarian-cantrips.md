# Avarian-Only Cantrips
The spell level of all of these are, no surprise, Cantrip. Also, the School of Magic has been left out as they don't fit nicely into the traditional schools, and will most often confuse people casting detect magic. 

## Activate/Deactivate
 * **Casting Time:** One Action
 * **Range:** Touch
 * **Components:** V, S
 * **Duration:** Instantaneous

You can activate or deactivate a charged object (either created by yourself or another) or a magic item, so long as it does not require attunement. If the object has multiple possible properties, you can choose which you activate. You must know of, or be able to make an educated guess about the object's property that you want to activate or deactivate.

## Bind
 * **Casting Time:** One Action
 * **Range:** Touch
 * **Components:** V, S
 * **Duration:** Varies, 24 hours to a 1 minute, depending on the target.

You can create a magical binding between two objects. This binding is temproary, and it allows one object to have access to the other, in terms of sensing and abilities. Creatures can be effected too, but with less duration.

An example of what this does is the best way to explain. Creating a Binding between yourself and a glass marble will allow you to know exactly where the marble is, as well as anything it can sense (proximity, contact, etc.) If it is transparent, you would be able to see through it. If it was a magical object, you would be able to use its abilities from any distance, but located at the object's location.

Bindings between two nonanimate objects lasts for 24 hours. Bindings between a creature and an object last for an hour, and bindings between two creatures last for a minute. 

If a binding is repeated every day for a year, then it becomes permanent.

## Change Form
 * **Casting Time:** One Action
 * **Range:** Touch
 * **Components:** V, S
 * **Duration:** Instantaneous

You can reshape up to 1 cubic inch of material into any shape. It must be an independent object (not part of a larger object). The material that the object is made from cannot change, so, for example, sand cannot be made into glass. The volume of the material also cannot be changed. Further, you can use this to split a small object into multiple parts (taking a cubic inch, and spliting it into two objects half a cubic inch) or combine mutible small objects into one, as long as the total volume is at most 1 cubic inch.

Once you reach 5th level, the maximum volume becomes 8 cubic inches. At level 27, it becomes nine cubic inches, and, at level 17, it becomes 32 cubic inches. These volumes correspond to a cube two, three, and four inches across  respectively. 

## Change Matter
 * **Casting Time:** One Action
 * **Range:** Touch
 * **Components:** V, S
 * **Duration:** Instantaneous

You can change the material of an object up to 1 cubic inch in volume to another material of equal or lesser value. It must be an independent object (not part of a larger object). The volume and the shape of the material also cannot be changed directly, though, they may change due to the nature of the new material. For example, turning a metal statue into sand will likely cause the new sand statue to quickly collapse into a pile.

Once you reach 5th level, the maximum volume becomes 8 cubic inches. At level 27, it becomes nine cubic inches, and, at level 17, it becomes 32 cubic inches. These volumes correspond to a cube two, three, and four inches across  respectively. 
 
## Charge
 * **Casting Time:** One Minute, or longer.
 * **Range:** Touch
 * **Components:** V, S (M) - the matter required by the charged cantrip, if any
 * **Duration:** Instantaneous

You place into an object a stored casting of a cantrip you know. As part of the casting of this cantrip, you cast the other, and must have the time and materials to do so, if it requires them. The effects of the cantrip are stored indefinately, and can be detected by Detect Magic or a high enough arcana check. When casting this cantrip, the exact nature of the stored cantrip must be stated. For example, if you store Change Form, the new shape must be specified during the casting of Charge.

The effects of a cantrip stored in a charged object can be released by the Activate/Deactivate cantrip, or the Logic cantrip. At the DM's discretion, other actions (such as breaking the object) may cause it to be released as well. Once released, the cantrip is consumed, and the object no longer stores this cantrip.

The success or failure of storing a cantrip in an object with Charge is entirely dependant on the structural integrity of the object, as well as the number of Logic Rules and Charged cantrips already in it. For example, a sheet of paper may be able to hold one Charge and one Rule, while a steel rod may be able to hold five of each. Further, living beings tend to change quickly, causing cantrips stored in them to be quickly wiped out.

Charging an object with the same cantrip every day for a month results in the charge becoming permanent, able to be activated again and again without depleting it. This is particularly useful with the Logic cantrip.

## Logic
 * **Casting Time:** One Action
 * **Range:** Touch
 * **Components:** V, S
 * **Duration:** Instantaneous

You bind a permanent logical rule to an object. When a specified condition is met, then the object will respond with a specified response. The object must be capable of sensing the specified condition, as well as capable of performing the response. For example, a rule such as "When kicked, float in the air for a minute" applied to a ordinary bucket will have no effect, as the bucket is incapable of floating on its own power. Likewise, a rule such as "When John turns twelve, crack in half" applied to a rock in the middle of the forest will likewise have no effect, as a rock cannot tell John's age, or even who John is. Further, logic Rules bound to living beings are often quickly wiped out as living beings change so quickly.

The most common usage of this is to activate stored cantrips via the Charge cantrip. A standard example is motion activated lights. A stone or bit of metal has the Light cantrip stored in it, and a Rule is made to activate it when there is motion nearby, or, when the object moves. Most objects can detect general proximity or self-motion, thought they cannot determine individuals, colors, or sounds. (They can detect there is a sound, or a bright light, not what it is.) More complex objects, like a optical lense, may be able to detect more senses, and more specific situations. The specifics are up to the DM's discretion.

The success or failure of binding a Rule to an object with Logic is entirely dependant on the structural integrity of the object, as well as the number of Logic Rules and Charged cantrips already in it. For example, a sheet of paper may be able to hold one Charge and one Rule, while a steel rod may be able to hold five of each. Further, living beings tend to change quickly, causing cantrips stored in them to be quickly wiped out.

## Manipulate
 * **Casting Time:** One Action
 * **Range:** 60 ft.
 * **Components:** V, S
 * **Duration:** Concentration, 1 minute

You can command the movement of an object 15 lbs or less, causing it to hover, move, and rotate as you dictate. The object must stay within 60 ft. or you, or regular physics takes effect. The object cannot make attacks, or used in such a way to activate a magic object. You can maintain this state for one minute, using a bonus action each turn to repeat the effects.

While this cannot directly deal damage, objects launched by this can deal damge if they hit things. This is not a spell attack, but a ranged attack from the user. The damage type and die are also not nesecarily the same as the object if it is a weapon. Further, the caster is not proficent in this attack.

Movement and control with this is simple, not nearly as nuanced as Mage Hand. The benefit is that this spell can be used with Charge to create an object that moves on its own. 



# Using these Cantrips
While having these interesting cantrips seems like it could be useful in some small situations, their real power is in how they work together. Together, they can be used to make almost any effect, having some seriously impressive results. 

For an example, here is a walkthrough of how to create Thor's Hammer using these cantrips.
The primary features that we will be replicating are: Returning to the User's Hand, Shocking Things, and Being unable to be picked up by the unworthy.

For starters, we will begin with returning to the hand. To do this, we must create a binding between the hammer and the creature. However, this should not be exclusive, or even permanent. We can use Charge every day for a month to permanently give the hammer the Bind cantrip. Once this is done, we use Logic to give it a rule that, when someone who meets our worthiness criteria grips the handle, the hammer binds to them. (It should be noted that if an individual picks up the hammer every day for a year, he or she will be permanently bound to it.)

Now, we have a binding. Using Charge, we can give the hammer the Manipulate cantrip, permanently again. Then, with another rule (When the bound creature extends his/her hand willing the hammer) the hammer casts Movement to move to the creature. And now we have returning to the user's hand.

Next up: shocking. A simple permanent Binding of Shocking Grasp will provide the electricity, and another Logic gives the user the ability to activate this with a thought, or a particular hand motion.

Finally, the unliftable part. We already have the Movement permanently bound to the hammer, so a simple Logic Rule causes the hammer to move in the opposite direction of a force granted by a non-bound creature.

And there we have Mj√∂lnir.

# Materials and their Capacity
This section describes some common materials and the number of Charges, Bindings, and Rules that they can have, safely. Attempting to add more than this can fail, with effects from nothing happens to the object explodes.

|**Material**       |**Capacity**|
|-------------------|-----------|
|Paper/Cloth        |1          |
|Softwood           |1          |
|Hardwood           |2          |
|Leather            |2          |
|Soft Stone         |3          |
|Lead               |3          |
|Mercury            |3          |
|Copper             |4          |
|Ceramics           |4          |
|Brass              |5          |
|Bronze             |5          |
|Iron               |5          |
|Hard Stone         |6          |
|Silver             |6          |
|Gold               |6          |
|Platinum           |7          |
|Electrum           |7          |
|Mithril            |8          |
|Gemstones          |8          |
|Adamantium         |10         |

Note that the manner in which an object is crafted can dramatically effect its capacity to carry the effects of these cantrips. A well-crafted object can generally carry more, while a poorly made one cannot carry as many.
