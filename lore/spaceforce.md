# Avarian SpaceForce

The Avarian SpaceForce is the primary military of the Empire. All this data is relevant to the year 3629 PA (post-Awakening), during the first Beholder War.


## Fleets and Rank

Each fleet works like an independent entity, sort of like the separate branches of the US Military. While they often work together, they have separate command structures, and generally their own hardware, funding, R&D, suppliers, and support systems. 

Each fleet is led by a single leader, the Commander. Commanders are normally hereditary positions, partially due to politics wanting to keep power in certain families, and partially because of the Genetic memories of the Avarian people. 

Under the Commander are the Captains, one for each major vessel (not including fighters, bombers, interceptors, landing craft, and other small vehicles) There are five ranks of Captains, with the different ranks designating the authority level. A first rank captain will often command the second largest capital ship, or a carrier, in the fleet, and so on to the fifth rank captain commanding a single frigate, the same class of ship as the Faoladh.
For each ship, directly under the Captain is the Chief of the Ship (often just called the Chief). In normal operations, only one of these two is allowed to have the Helm, or, command of the vessel. They often trade six hour shifts, though this can vary from ship to ship. On the flagship of the fleet, the Commander can also have the Helm, or, in case of emergency, (such as when the crew of one ship is transferred to another due to the first being abandoned) there may be multiple Captains and Chiefs on the same vessel, and the guest ones are permitted to take the Helm with the permission of the highest ranking officer.

Under the Chief of the Ship, there are the Lieutenants. There is generally one per major designation on the ship, such as the Infantry Lieutenant, the Interceptor Lieutenant, the Artillery Lieutenant, and so on. There are also some directed at specific parts of the ships infrastructure, such as the Engine, as well as the General Quarters Lieutenant. 

Under these, commanding specific squadrons, are the Officers. Like the Captains, there are five ranks. While a first-rank officer is technically superior to a fifth rank officer, the fifth rank does not report to the first-rank, unless their units are joined for some exercise. It is these units that get the letter designation and nickname in the coding system.

Under the officer of a particular unit, there is the Master Sergeant, and zero or more Sergeants. 
Then comes the rank and file Troopers, who are the lowest rank. 

### Fleet Deployments

Currently, there are 8 fleets. (the 5th fleet was lost, though, some still hope for its return.)
The fleets 1-4 (and 5, if it returns) are the Core Fleets, which defend the Core worlds. The rest are the Protector fleets, which defend the colonies, the worlds in the empire that are not the core worlds.

#### 1st Fleet

Defends Avalon.

Stationed in the Avalon system, this fleet is the oldest, and considered the most important. It has the unique status of using gold, white, and purple in its design.
This fleet is commanded by Commander Kallius Morn, a capable commander and rather skilled and dedicated.

Commander Morn is  known to hold a deep grudge against Commander Bercolli, from some unknown incident when they were both young. Commander Bercolli has never spoken about what it is, but Commander Morn has gone on public record to decry Bercolli. Things between them have been quiet for a few years. 

#### 2nd Fleet

Defends Westeress. 

This fleet is commanded by Commander Marcus Bosco. He is not lazy, he does actually work from his command ship, he is just not particularly tactically savvy.

#### 3rd Fleet

Defends Argile and Swanheil.

This fleet is commanded by Commander Tiffany Blore, who has only set foot on her flagship once: when accepting the position after her father retired. Her fleet is tiny, unequipped, and rather poor. She seems to be more interested in the latest fashion than in commanding her fleet. 
Her First Captain, Captain First Rank Harold Rodric, however, is a dedicated man, who upholds the fleet as best as he can. He trained under former Commander Jacob Bercolli, father of the current Commander Julius Bercolli, of the 9th Fleet.

#### 4th Fleet

Defends Atlantis, and in the absence of the 5th Fleet, Utopos.

This fleet is commanded by Commander Emily Forin, who is a strong and capable commander, training side by side with Commander Julius Bercolli when they were both young.

#### 6th Fleet

Defends Trupidia, Hathendrome, Oveath, and Torillia

This fleet is commanded by Commander Hagarth Forn, who very rarely spends time on his command ship. This fleet is incredibly lazy, undisciplined, and unprepared.

#### 7th Fleet

Defends Corilary Major and Minor, Veridis, Harmony, Anthem and Sparta

This fleet is commanded by Commander Trinian Lang, and he is a strong and capable commander, having been the closest person to ever being Commander Julius Bercolli at space chess. He still lost. But he actually took one of Bercolli’s pieces. Commander Lang is known for being very short, but very strong. He is not a man to cross.

#### 8th Fleet

Defends Ettenweil and Korvan.

This fleet is commanded by Commander Kris Vanelis, and she is a demanding commander, who shows great strength. Her father, on the other hand, who is still alive, was one of the most decadent, corrupt commanders, who was often found drunk on Avalon, having wandered into someone’s house and “requisitioned” it. He is now bedridden, and is near death, but has written his daughter out of his will in spite. This was a well known event at the time, as he decided to publish a statement saying he was doing so. It was all over the gossip postings for months.

#### 9th Fleet

Defends Tel-Avan, Noctis, Terra, and the Halcion Cluster.

This fleet is commanded by the legendary Commander Julius Bercolli, who is known as being a tactical genius and a military reformer. His and his father’s work has nearly rooted all the decadence from the Avarian Spaceforce, and brought it up to fighting standard.

## Ships and their Capabilities

This section is incomplete, and contains information that would only be known to members of the Avarian SpaceForce, the Greater Spartan Army, or particularly persistent military observers.

### A quick note on ship Generations

Each ship class belongs to a numbered generation, with usually only the latest three serving. The technological difference between generations is quite vast. Generations 1 - 23 are all retired, with few from even generation 23 still existing, having been scrapped for their mithril. Generation 24 is currently rather old, while Generation 25 is called “Current Gen”. The first few Generation 26 ships have entered service, these “Next Gen” ships are a vast upgrade over generation 25. Unlike previous generations, Generation 26 was developed in secret, by the Bercolli family. The publicly planned (but not yet in production) generation 26 has been renamed Generation 25.5, and has been scrapped. Only generations 24, 25, and 26 will be documented here. 

The major difference between generation 24 and generation 25 is the removal of internal steel plating, as magboots are replaced by gravboots for zero-g operations. This decreased the cost of the ships significantly, as well as lightened them, the steel is much heavier than the current ACM (Adamantine Ceramic Matrix) used in generation 25 and onwards. the ACM is itself much stronger and more chemically resistant than the steel. This, along with introduction of lager caliber assult turrets and improved railguns, makes generation 25 ships significantly better. They are also nearly 10% cheaper due to the replacement of steel. 

The major difference between generation 25 and generation 26 is much greater. The first and most obvious difference is that generation 26 ships have Neutronium hulls, that are nearly black compared to the light-tan ACM hulls of generation 25 ships. This is much lighter, though significantly more expensive. It also makes the ships an order of magnitude tougher. Note that not all generation 26 ships have a neutronium hulls, it only really benefits the larger capitol ships, due to its protective capabilities being directly proportional to the surface are of the shell. Other improvements include the use of shipboard AI onboard all ships, as well as a complete compliment of unmanned assult ships, and a whole new set of ship classifications that are entirely unmanned.  The total crew needed on Capitol ships is vastly reduced. This is all part of a policy to reduce the number of people in combat craft. 

### Ship Types and Classes

#### Capitol ships

Capitol ships are the combat-face of the fleet, each with many individuals aboard.

##### Battlecruisers
The battlecruiser is the cornerstone of the Avarian Spaceforce, providing the command-and-control center for an entire fleet. Each fleet has one Battlecruiser, as these large ships are hard and expensive to manufacture. A Battlecruiser has a number of assult ship squadrons that dock with it, as well as a powerful railgun that spans the length of the ship. These railguns can fire projectiles at nearly the speed of light, resulting in an enemy usually only having milliseconds to spot the projectile. The battlecruiser is also equipped with large assult turrets, smaller point-defense turrets, torpedoes, and strategic missiles. 
Crew: 700 - 1000

*Asmodeus Class*
The Asmodeus Class is a Generation 24 battlecruiser, and is currently not in use as a battlecruiser, but as a battleship, due to its aging infrastructure. The ship has an iconic “m” shape from the front, and from the top, looks sort of like a castle, a big wall, a center spire, and two flanking towers. 

- Crew: 980 (140 absolute minimum)
- Dimensions: 230 meters in length, 120 meters wide, 60 meters tall 
- Rail Gun: 80,634 Kg tungsten sphere, 1 meter projectile radius, 864.8 Gigaton yield (thousand megatons). 12 minutes refresh
- Strategic Missiles:
    - 280 Jasmine missiles (70 launch tubes) 
    - 120 Hammerhead missiles (30 launch tubes)

    - 8 shuttles.

*Daedalus Class*
The Daedalus Class Battlecruiser is the Generation 25 Battlecruiser, and is the most used battlecruiser in the Spaceforce at this time. These vessels are the face of the Spaceforce, their distinctive ‘H’ shape from the front. While its crew is slightly smaller than the Asmodeus, this is due to increased automation and more space used for armaments.
The major differences from the Asmodeus class are significant. The overall shape was changed to accommodate larger engines and gun emplacements that are mounted on the two side sections, thermally insulated from the main core. This gives the vessel much more thermal stability than the Asmodeus vessel, which had to use thermal radiation panels on its flat top to manage heat during heavy operations. This redesign does reduce the total crew capacity, but significantly increases munitions. This class also does not contain internal steel sheeting for magboots. It also contained a significantly more complex computer piloting system, but is nowhere near the shipboard AI systems. 

- Crew: 850 (130 absolute minimum)
- Dimensions: 250 meters in length, 125 meters wide, 90 meters tall
- Rail Gun: 146,574 Kg tungsten sphere, 1.2 meter projectile radius, 1,573.3 Gigaton yield. 10 minutes refresh.

*Valkyrie Class*
The brand new Generation 26 Battlecruiser, there is only one Valkyrie Class ship in operation at this time: ASF Fortitude, flagship of the 9th fleet and the command vessel of Commander Julius Bercolli, this ship is the most formidable single weapon ever developed. No expense was spared in designing and building this ship, or its sisters. 
The ship is clad in a neutronium hull, thus the vessel is nearly pitch black. The shape is carefully designed to also make it difficult to pick the ship up on radar, or, more accurately, make it look like a much smaller ship, making this one of the first true stealth battlecruisers.
The shipboard AI is capable of completely running the ship on its own, as well as managing the fleet and their shipboard AI.
The ship also features two parallel railguns, of different sizes, so that one can be reloaded while the other fires. This was thought to be too unstable, but significant new technology allows it. One is designed to fire significantly smaller projectiles, allowing it to be reloaded much faster, even though its yield is less than a tenth of the larger one, it is still a planet killing weapon. Other armament changes include a overall reduction in the number of strategic missiles in favor of far more torpedoes and light ships. There was also an effort to reduce the types of munitions, instead replacing them with more versatile types, decreasing inventory complexity.

##### Carriers
Carriers are ships dedicated to holding and transporting assult ships, such as fighters, bombers, and interceptors. They also have the space for the pilots, supplies, and all other systems needed to man the small ships. In the case of the loss of a fleet’s battlecruiser, command and control passes to one of the Carriers. Which one is known only to the Commander of the fleet and the captains of the Carriers. It is common for a fleet to have one to three of these ships, though one is the most common.
Crew: 500 - 1500

##### Battleships
The battleship is a heavily armed and armored craft, like a smaller version of a Battlecruiser. Like the Battlecruiser, they are equipped with a railgun, assult turrets, torpedoes, strategic missiles, and point-defense turrets, as well as a small number of assult ships. Each fleet may have three to four battleships, though none have more than six, or less than two.
Crew: 400 - 800

##### Gunships
Think a railgun, with engines. These are light, have very small crew quarters, and are mostly railgun. Some don’t even have point defense systems. 
Crew: 20-40

##### Cruisers
Smaller than battleships, cruisers don’t have railguns, they are too small. They generally are heavily armed with assult turrets, missiles, torpedoes, as well as a solid point defense array. They generally have some attached assult ships, including shuttles. 
Cruisers are often atmosphere hardened, allowing them to enter planetary atmospheres, unlike the larger types of ships. 
Crew: 150 - 600

##### Destroyers
Smaller than Cruisers, Destroyers make up a good chunk of the Spaceforce. They are generally equipped with assult turrets, torpedoes, and point-defense systems, though a few do also have strategic missiles. They can support several assult ships A fleet will generally have two to three squadrons of destroyers, with five ships each. These squadrons are capable of operating independently, with a Cruiser of Battleship as their squadron lead. This allows a single fleet to be spread around the system.
Crew: 30 - 100

##### Frigates
The smallest of capitol ships, Frigates are generally only armed with cannons, torpedoes and point-defense systems. They are too small for the large assult turrets, as well as too small for a chaos reactor power plant (though, recent developments in this technology are changing that). Frigates can have one or two assult ships dock with it, though this is no hanger bay. 
Crew: 4 - 15


#### Light Ships

Light ships make the majority of the ships in the fleet, each only having room for one or two occupants.

##### Fighters
Fighters are pure ship-to-ship attack craft. They are designed to be on the offensive.  They are fast, maneuverable, and most of their weapons point forward, usually only having one or two point-defense turrets, and the rest being forward-facing cannons or short-range torpedoes. 

##### Interceptors
Interceptors are more defensive craft, tending to have much better scanning equipment than a fighter, as well as larger engines (they beat fighters in raw speed), though are far less maneuverable. They tend to have many more long range weapons, and many more point-defense weapons. They don’t usually have large forward-facing cannons, but instead have larger point-defense turrets they use for attacking, as well as a greater number of missiles. 

##### Bombers
Bombers are specifically ship-to-ground attack systems. Some are larger, being heavy and loaded with many, many bombs, while others are lighter, and even only carry light ship-to ground missiles. While they definitely have point-defense systems, they mostly rely on a fighter or interceptor escort for protection.

##### Multi-Role Craft
It is uncommon nowadays to see craft that are only fighters or only interceptors, but rather craft that can fit all three roles, depending on what they are outfitted with. These craft are far more common, and several variants exist, that have different quirks.

##### Attack Shuttles
Attack shuttles are sort of a hybrid between a shuttle and a fighter. They have room for 3-8 people for a short-range trip (ie, no sleeping, cooking, or the like on board), but also have some large Cannons, large engines, and more point-defense than a regular shuttle. These are often used to when trying to get infantry to a location, or breach another ship.

##### Autonomous Light Ships
These ships have no pilot, being navigated by a non-sentient AI given commands and targets from a central controller. These are significantly lighter, faster, and more heavily armed than manned ships, due to their lack of any need for life support or a crew cabin.
 

#### Non-Combat Ships

Non-Combat ships, such as transports, shuttles, gas haulers, and the like, are essential for the support of the Spaceforce.



#### Specialized ships

Specialized ships, such as planetary dropships, breaching pods, etc. fall into this classification.
 

### Armament Types

#### Rail Guns

Rail guns are large and dangerous weapons. They fire their payload (often a solid cylinder or sphere of tungsten) at 99.94% the speed of light (or thereabouts). This gives them tremendous energy, and they can blast through any known shield. One hitting the surface of a planet causes catastrophic damage, that will likely result in the planet loosing its ability to host life, if it had it. Hitting a ship will tear it apart, first by punching a hole through it, then by causing so much kinetic energy and heat to be transferred to it that parts will vaporize, resulting in a shock wave, even in the vacuum of space. 
Due to the size of the rail gun, most ships only have one, and it runs from stem to stern, only aimed by turning the entire ship. 


#### Assult Turrets

Assult turrets are large, charged spellshot weapons. Just like handheld spellshots, they work by shattering a charged crystal.  The main difference is that the crystals used in these cannons are often 4 to 6 feet long, and 6 inches to 2 feet in diameter. They are made by massive, powerful machines, and are very dangerous if they go off unexpectedly, so they are kept in protective metal and ceramic casings. Due to the sheer size of the rounds, these cannons are rather slow to fire. 
The damage that they can output is high, though nowhere near a rail gun. The advantage is that these are not the length of the ship itself. They can be rotated independently of the ship, and many can fire simultaneously. They are particularly useful for close-range combat against other large ships, planetary targets, or other targets, where the Rail gun is not practical and too close for nuclear weapons.


#### Mounted Cannons

Mounted Cannons are common on smaller ships that cannot carry assult turrets. They are technically railguns, though, they do not fire their projectiles anywhere near as fast as true railguns, and they most often fire charged, superheated plasma. This plasma often exists forming a tight doughnut shape in atmospheres, which makes them less effective in these scenarios. 
The advantage of this is that they do not require complicated mechanics to reload, allowing a more powerful gun to be attached to a smaller ship, such as a fighter.


#### Point-Defense Turrets

Point-Defense turrets are smaller spellshots, often fully automatic, that are set up to have complete coverage of any incoming craft. They usually file 1cm to 4cm diameter ammunition, which is larger than most handheld weapons. Larger than this, and they become too slow to reload to fire fast enough to hit incoming missiles. 


#### Torpedoes

Torpedoes are short-range, ship-to-ship missiles, and are rarely nuclear, though that does not mean that they do not pack a punch. A strong ceramic tip, often re-enforced with adamantium, is used to allow them to pierce the armor plating of enemy ships before detonating, ensuring maximum damage. 
Many specialized versions exist, from ones that deliver gas canisters, to ones that create powerful EMP blasts once onboard, to ones that have a paint-filled soft tip for training. It is becoming more common for later-gen versions to use smaller nuclear warheads with yields in the range of 1-50 kilotons.

#### Strategic Missiles  

Strategic missiles are for long range ship-to-surface or ship-to-ship combat, and contain nuclear payloads often in the range of 25 to 100 megatons. These missiles have advanced navigation and guidance systems, as well as stealth systems, built-in hazard avoidance, and a premature detonation systems. They are designed to destroy their target in one shot, no questions asked.
