# Avalon
Capitol of the Empire, the planet Avalon is the original homeworld of the Ariveros Race. It is a suitably strange place, boasting impressive purple foliage in its plants instead of the typical green. 

However, the planet Avalon is not the only inhabited planet or location in the Avalon System. 

## Planets of the System
The primary habitable planet is [Avalon](#avalon-the-planet). 

## Avalon, the planet
When most visitors arrive at Avalon for the first time, they expect an industrial world, covered in cities. While Avalon is densely populated, the population is concentrated in major cities, leaving much of the planet free to nature, and agriculture. Many natural wonders exist on the planet, from the impressive Golden Falls (Waterfalls that run over Gold-Rich ore, causing golden light to sparkle off everything nearby) to the Crystal Caves of Chiming Sounds.

Foliage on this planet takes strong purple hues due to a high level of [anthocyanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin), a chemical with strong blue-purple colors. This is because the planet receives a lot of light from its sun, far more than Earth. The anthocyanin acts as a natural sunscreen for the plants, preventing them from burning up. On Earth, this chemical is responsible for the blue or purple colors of some plans and flows, like blueberries, red cabbage, and red grapes.

Much of the planet's soil is artificial, due to the massive reforestation project, that ressurected the planet's ecosystem from almost total collapse. 

### Cities of Avalon
Several cities existed on the surface of Avalon, as well as numerous small towns. Much of the planet was left wild, after a massive reforestation project to repair damage to the planet's ecosystem. Notibly, these included Archeron, the capitol of both the planet and the Empire at large.

#### Archeron
The primary city of Avalon, Archeron, is impressive sight too. It is laid out in a massive five-pointed star, the general height of the city's buildings slowly increasing from the edges to its highest in the center. Along the center of each of the five arms is a large flat area, often decorated with gardens, called spines. 

Here, the engineering took on an impressive task: how to build a capitol that was not densly packed, and allowed thousands to live in it, without being miserable and ugly? They had an ingenious solution: Make the buildings fly. While this would have been impractical to do to all the buildings, the major ones that lay on the five spines are all flying. Thus, the spines are constantly shaded by the buildings floating forty or more feet above them. 

But how to access these buildings? Each one has at least one teleport array just under it that takes people to and from the lobby. Larger transport is done using ships, as all the flying buildings have at least one docking port, normally near the top.

The further you get from the spines, the less rich the city gets. While there are no "poor" here, indeed, there is always need for more workers, there are those who are less well-to-do. While no one lives in buildings that float above the spines, the housing areas further from it are filled with the less fortunate.

The center pentagon where the five arms of the city meet is a special place. No flying towers are allowed in, and it legally is not part of the planet. It is the seat of government for the entire Empire. It is in this small segment that the offices of the Exeutors and the Senate Building are, as well as Starfleet Command, the primary building of the Department of War and the central military authority of the Empire. The entire area is a no-fly zone, and access is monitored and, if nesecary, restricted.
