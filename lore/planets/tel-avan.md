# Tel-Avan
The densly forested homeworld of the [Telwar](../../charoptions/races.md#telwar) lies in it's system, the Tel-Avan system.

|[Tel-Avan](#tel-avan-1)|[Inhabitants](#inhabitants---the-telwar-people)|

## Planets of the System
Several gas giants lie in the outer areas of the system, while two planets lie within the Goldilocks Zone: the jungle world or Tel-Avan and the icy persudoplanet of Appalos.

## Tel-Avan
A hot and steamy jungle, Tel-Avan is a wild world. The Avarians would have considered it too much effort to tame and settle, due to the massive numbers of poisonous plants, vicious animals, and all-around hostility. However, it is in this enviroment that the Telwar thrive. 

### Flora
The natural plant life or Tel-Avan is enormous in number. From mysterious plants that live in the cloud forests near the poles, to mushrooms that grow underground, never seeing the light of day, to massive trees that can reach hundreds of feet in the air, to small shrubs that one touch can kill out.

Due to the vast variety, it is not wise of anyone not trained in survival here to wander around without a guide.

### Fauna
Life on Tel-Avan is vicious and short for many creatures. Due to the high oxygen content of the planet's atmosphere, insects can grow to be very large, without the aid of magic. Further, massive reptiles are common, be that in the form of snakes, lizards, or flying byren. Mammals are usually the prey here, and few species are larget than housecats. However, some mammals have made it to the top of the food chain, including the fearsome Maw Tiger. While most mammals have hair, several species of creatures exist that are like mammals in almost every way except for one difference: they are hairless. They also have special hollow tail-like structures on their heads instead of ears. The planet's intelligent species, the Telwar, are one of these, though, a few monkey-like creatures fall into the same class.

### Cities
Telwar cities are hard to find, not because they are scarce, but because they look no different from the rest of the jungle to the untrained eye. The Telwar build equally around large trees as they do just under the surface, in pit houses. The majority of all Telwar architecture is carved from the surrounding material, then sealed against the elements and corrosion. 

With rain coming every day, water is an important part of life, things are rarely dry. However, the best way to deal with this is actually to get more wet, thus, the rain does not effect you. Thus, Telwar cities are often near water sources, and inconsiderate numerous pools and baths into them.

Markets and other nonresidental buildings are often built by those who use them, the family business. Ground-based markets are large open air complexes sunk under the ground level, often having many entrances, exits, underground passages, and covered pit buildings through them. Larger, taller buildings begin as a pit building, but get a timber framed top portion instead of a roof. Tree based markets are often on large platforms that span several trees, and can be treacherous to navigate. rope bridges connect various platforms, and long wood spans can connect several trees together. Short fences take the place of walls, and there are no roves. 

## Appalos
The persudoplanet of Appalos is almost entirely covered in ice, except for seas and lakes of saltwater, due to its lower freezing temperature. Many races of fish live here, but no mammals or land-dwelling creatures.

## Inhabitants - the Telwar People
The Telwar are a secretive people, often wanting to avoid the notice of the louder races. Their incredibly sensitive hearing allows them to speak at a volume most races would find inaudible, and even in frequencies that most races cannot hear or produce. Thus, when with other races, they must always shout (from their perspective) to be able to be heard clearly. Some people call the Telwar "Mumblers" because of their naturally soft and quiet voices, however, this is considered very rude. Another name they are often given is "Spike-Heads" or a derivation, due to the head-tails that allow them to hear. Again, this is rude, and not heard in polite society. It also can be grounds for the Telwar insulted so to defend the name of his or her people and family with extreme prejudice.

### Telwar Families and Homes
To the Telwar, there is nothing more important than family. Everything is done in this context. The idea that people would not have a family is absurd to them. Family build their house together, live there together, run a buisness together, eat together, and pray together.

A newly married couple will often together build their home, or, more frequently, an extension to the family home of the groom for them to live in. This is the first thing they do together, and work is only allowed to begin once they are married. They do not share of the marriage bed until they have built it. This does not often take long, as  Telwar homes are small. 

Telwar homes are minimalist in design, having a greatroom that functions as a living room, a dining room, and a kitchen, while separate areas are mostly reserved for sleeping. Sometimes seperate bathing quarters are made, but often there is a large pool in the greatroom for this purpose. As the Telwar family grows, children not of the firstborn line often make their own homes seperate from the family home when they find spouses. As a family house gets larger and larger, the greatroom is often extended, enlarged, and new sleeping chambers are made for children. The greatroom is sometimes partitioned into a network of smaller ones, each maintained by a particular part of the family, and often having a particular purpose. 

The family buisness often has its headquarters in the home, but, any special rooms needed for it, such as a market or a workshop, are often connected to the home, but are not often considered formally part of it.

When a home is made around an on a tree, a suitable hardwood tree, a hundred feet tall or so, is found, and it is used as the central pillar of a multi-story house. Each floor is build so that it supports its entire weight against the trunk, with no weight on the floor below. Starways lead from floor to floor. It is often the first floor that has the family greatroom. Often these homes build their first floor several feet above the ground, requiring a ladder to enter.

When a home is carved into the ground, as a pit house, everything is on one level. Each room is carved from the top down, leaving support buttresses, columns, and various floor levels in place. Then, doorways are carved between them, as short tunnels. Once this is done, the entire house is roofed and covered in dirt, the only entrance being a stair that is often well hidden. 

The type of house that a family may construct is entirely dependent on where they live. If there is a lot of flooding, then the tree houses are used exclusively. However, if the soil is right, and flooding is rare if ever, pit houses are used. There are other house types built, like those carved into the sides of cliffs. 

The Greatroom of any house is likely ringed with niches full of potted plants. These plants, though beautiful, are not just decoration. Many are the food source of the family, while others produce the saps and gums that are needed to make common items, while others produce medicine. 

### Techology of the Telwar
The Telwar are spectacular at biotechnology and bioengineering, being able to engineer plants to serve their every need. They are also excellent at utilizing minerals to their advantage, and have a wide varity of technologies.

Lighting is done by special minerals, rough, opalescent rocks that glow if they are left in the dark. The warm glow from these rocks is almost synonymous with the Telwar. They do not sell these rocks to non-Telwar, as they believe the louder races will become jealous and try and mine their planet for them. 

Communication is done through a series of scrying bowls, special silver bowls with water and oil and special sap in them. This network is simple and requires no maintenance, making it perfect for these minimalist people.

Weapons are readily avalable, as the Telwar have developed physical projectile firearms, and have advanced the technology well beyond what would be expected. Their light-gas guns are dangerous and powerful, utilizing a vast array of materials. What is more impressive is that the ammunition is grown! Entire bullets, casing, propellant, and all are grown by a special plant. This is not known outside of the Telwar people, as it is yet another secret that they have, believing the louder races would use this for ill.

### Religion and Philosophy of the Telwar
Like the Telwar lifestyle, Telwar philosophy is based around the idea of the family. Family is the core unit of society, and the foundation of its laws and morals. It is wrong to do somthing that brings harm to your family. If someone harms your family, you have the right to seek repayment or retribution, as long as you do not exceed what was done to you or cause physical harm. The father is the leader of the family, so the elder is the leader of a village. The mother cares for the family, so the healer cares for the village. (care being used to mean nurture, heal, and teach.)

The family-centric approach is seen too in their religion. They have two primary deities, one called Aba (Āba), or, the father of us, the other called Ima, (Īma) or, the mother of us. They are never pictured or worshipped alone, always together. (Which is why some outside their culture think that they worship one deity called Aba-Ima, or Abima. This is incorrect.) A depiction of them, either flanking a door, or holding hands, is almost a universal feature of Telwar homes. Before them sits the incense bowl, (or, if separate, above the mantle of the door). Here, incense is kept burning constantly, often incense sticks, but others use charcoal and incense powder. 

The primary form of worship is offerings. These are simple things, done on special days. Whatever the offering is, it is made of a flammable material, like wood. These are taken to the incense bowl, which has had a small fire lit in it (more than just burning incense), and placed inside, with an intonation of "For the pleasure of Aba and Ima, I offer this *name of the item* to you for *some favor* for me and my family." If no favor is being asked for, then after the name of the item, " from my heart." is said. If the offering is in thanksgiving, " for the favor of *name of favor* granted to me and my family." is said. 

Offerings could be made at any time, particularly when one wants to ask for a favor. However, some days were special, and the head of the family made a offering, slightly larger in size, and usually worked on by more than one person. With this offering, he would intone "For the pleasure of Aba and Ima on this *special day name*, I offer this *name of the item*, the work of our hands, for the life and joy of my family." There are several key differences in this, namely, that they claim that the offering is a work of the hands, ie, its not a particularly ripe fruit. Secondly, the head of the family does not ask for life and joy for himself, just for his family.

Special occasions occur at several specific times. Full moons are considered special, and worthy of having a special offering made under moonlight. The birth of a child is special for the whole family, and its anniversary special for that child thereafter, another day worthy of a special offering. A particularly unique one is the day of the blooming of the Felippios tree, a species of tree that blooms only every ten years. The flowers of this tree are gathered and used to make special incense to be burned through the years, any leftovers are burned when the tree blooms again.

When traveling, it would not be uncommon for the traveler to have a small statue of the two deities, and a small incense bowl, for making offerings while on the road. If the person is not the head of his family, he makes the offerings for the special day as if he is. (Women are not required to do this, but they often do.)
