# Noctis
The system of Noctis is known for two things: it hosts the homeworld of the gnomes, and it hosts the moon Midnight

## Galvon
Galvon, the homeworld of the gnomes, is a wild planet. After having suffered a calamity due to a massive magical accident, the planet started shifting itself around on its own. Large areas of wild magic often appear, then disappear just as suddenly. A city may be transported to a different part of the planet without warning. The local gnomes have been trying for a long time to fix this, but they now have resigned themselves to just dealing with it. 

Avarian presence on Galvon is similar to colonies. For the most part, they allow the gnomes to self-rule, but all rulings of the gnome council must be approved by the local Avarian governor. Enforcement of the laws is also handled by the local Avarian police force. 

## Midnight
A strange planet, Midnight is a moon of a Hot Gas Giant. It is also located in the exact spot so that it is always in the shadow of its host planet, meaning, it has never seen the light of its star. This, combined with the thin atmosphere, makes the stars visible all the time, as well as the radiant rings of its host planet. 

The light atmosphere is not enough for any creature to breathe, but that did not stop settlers. Its warm temperature means that the only life support needed is a simple mask rebreather. The pressure is low enough that dust does not hang in the air, but instead falls like sand, no matter how fine it is. 

Due to these two factors, the moon is popular for both fancy bars, often with force-field or glass roves, with a roaring nightlife, as well as crime-filled dark streets. The bars are easy to understand, the continuous night and beautiful views make it a wonderful place to kick back and relax, or perform other activities. There are establishments of all scales, in the crowded, narrow settlement. Light pollution is strictly regulated, with the exception of the spaceport, most colors of lights are banned, with the exception of red. (This color does not destroy night vision) 

The crime feeds on the legitimate business of this planet. It is mostly petty thievery, armed robbery, and the like. A few less than legal clubs exist, including fight clubs, hallucinogenic drug dens, and houses of ill repute. However, the local law enforcement does little to stop this kind of business, as long as it does not infringe on the other businesses of the settlement, and obey the light rules.
