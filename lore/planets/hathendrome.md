# Hathendrome
A large system with many inhabited planets, Hathendrome is an important place in the empire. Due to the star's size and relative coolness, its goldilocks zone is rather wide. The orbit of these planets prevents them from ever getting too near to each other.

## Planets of the System
There are five inhabitable planets and several moons. The first is Kesseli, followed by Trimactol, then Braesus, Nevvelia, and finally Aarvanos. Trimactol has two habitable moons, Frexo and Biras. Nevvelia has an inhabited moon Turtuv.

## Kesseli
A warm, bright world, this planet has no ice caps. Though, its poles are the only place snow is ever seen. Much of the planet is large mountains covered in cloud forests. Lower lying areas are great dry dust bowls, with little vegitation. Higher latitudes are more forgiving, with evergreen trees beginning to grow near the poles. Seasons on the planet are very mild, part of the short year (78 days) being on average 10 degrees warmer than the other. Temperatures float between 35 and 45 near the equator, while the poles are often a balmy 5 to 15. 

This planet would normally be far too hot for life, except it has a highly reflective cloud layer that reflects about 85% of the light hitting it back into space. This layer is mostly water vapor, though some carbon compounds present in it cause it to increase in reflectivity. Thus, the surface is much cooler than would be expected. Areas of desert often lack this protection and can have temperatures rising to 71 degrees (Note: all degrees are in Celcius.)

There is a large push to further agricultural development on this world, and some large farming colonies exist. These colonies have found the woods of this world to be particularly strong, and some even contain natural carbon fiber. This helps strengthen them against the high winds in the valley resulting from the vast temperature differences between the misty, shielded forests and the hot, unshielded deserts. 

Two notable ports include the colony of Meximon and the colony of Gabrielli. 

#### Meximon
Located on the flat top of a mountain, Meximon is a colony shrouded in mist. Most of the colony is prefabricated buildings brought in from space and landed by dropships. A large number of trees were felled to make room for the colony, both for buildings and the new fields, which are growing a large variety of leafy greens. 

The culture of this settlement is a fairly positive one. It has about a hundred residents, about 67 of which are adult workers, the rest are children (mostly human).

#### Gabrielli
Located higher in latitude than Meximon, the settlement of Gabrielli is much larger colony, built in a large valley. It has a population of about 680 individuals, some were even born there. It has a number of buildings built from both local and imported materials, while some prefabs remain. The culture is well developed, and there is even a local custom type of alcohol (for humans). 

## Trimactol
Trimactol is a well-developed world, with great oceans, varying land masses, and most notably, is the homeworld of the halflings. The halflings are by far the most populous group on the planet. The Empire has a presence here, but due to normal Avarian Empire policies, but it is not heavy handed. There is little self-government for the halflings, but the halflings have never been big into government anyway. They are a peaceful, happy people, and this attitude has infected the Avarian population on the planet, its known for being very laid back. The haflings don't like cities, their versions are more like suburbs. Businesses are all family-owned and run, often for more than ten generations. This has made it hard for the natives to do business with the much larger businesses off-world, however, since nearly all halflings don't care for this sort of thing. This has caused Trimactol to be excluded from much of the larger business cycle of the Empire. Much of its money stays internal, which works with the Impreial tax systems, as planets are taxed based off of the value of what they import (which is practically nothing on Trimactol). 

Trimactol has only one large spaceport, Bellbury Spaceport. The vast majority of ships though this are public transports

## Frexo (moon)
The moon Frexo was terraformed early in the life of the Empire. Once a lifeless, airless rock, it now has an artificial atmosphere, and is basically all green and blue. This moon is now covered in farms, ranches, and a few small cities. It is mostly Avarian in population, with a few humans and haflings. 

## Biras (moon)
The moon Biras is in the process of being terraformed. Its atmosphere is breathable, but currently still a little thin. It does not have many oceans to speak of, but as more and more icy asteroids are brought there, this is changing.
Some plants are starting to grow, but this is slow as the ground is not yet fully nourishing. It is mostly limited to areas that have been artificially fertilized with decomposed biomass from Trimactol. While there are no cities yet, the moon does house Griat Station, the home to the Terraforming team and the only place with real structures on the moon, besides the old abandoned mining facilities. 

## Braesus
A smaller world, Braesus is thick and cloudy. From space, it looks like a white marble. Under its heavy clouds lies a world that is mostly a low ocean, for it has no tides to speak of. Some landmasses jut out, sharp and spiky above the water, but they make up less than 10% if its surface. Its thick ice caps to the north and south are large and stable. On the southern one is the city Silfian, a cold place, full of ice fishing, low-temputure manufacturing, and strangely, the home office for the Tekkon corporation, a major firearms producer. Silfian also has a number of facilities outside the city bounds that serve as data storage vaults for many companies, where large amounts of data are backed up on storage devices kept at low temperatures. These massive vaults are closely guarded and monitored. 

## Nevvelia
The world of Nevvelia is a bright one, its flora and fauna being particularly colorful. This is believed to be due to the high abundance of magical energy on the planet. Many of the native species have some sort of interaction with magic, meaning, most of them cannot live anywhere else. This world is decently populated, and has several major cities. Luvian, the capitol, is a large city, that is a popular tourist destination. Other cities include Abrasos, Vemmzia, and Curecvel. There is also the College of Braxion, a post-graduate university.

### Luvian
Luvian, the capitol of Nevvelia, is a luxurious city. Much of the money of this city comes from tourism, and it has many industries in that area. It likes to portray itself as a center of the arts, though this is not the case, it cannot compete with Atlantis. It is full of narrow but bright streets, few vehicles are allowed inside the walls, to keep it friendly to people on foot. Outside, to the south, are great fields and pastures, some set up for looks, others functional, growing and raising the many species that can only be done so on this planet.
To the north is the great Twilight Forest, which is bound to confuse any unprepared traveler, for navigating it is impossible, until you learn to read the forest like the locals. Deep magic permeates it, preventing traditional navigation systems from working, and it is constantly changing internally. 

### Abrasos
Often referred to as "The Jewel of the South", this city lies on the southern half of the planet. The soil it is built on is a gentle sky blue, and this color has taken in the city, which has a sort of semi-translucent architecture, making it look like a gemstone set in the ground from a distance. 

This city has a massive pharmaceutical industry, a number of medicines used through the Empire are manufactured here, due to a wide variety of magical plants that have powerful healing properties. These are grown, refined, and packaged as drugs. 

But all is not well here. A specific medical compound, Vaxia, is used in some drugs to enhance their healing ability, as it has the effect of strengthening magical effects. It can only be safely used in tiny doses, otherwise, its rather unfortunate side effects occur, including the crystallization of flesh. It is not uncommon to see people with hands or feet of a bluish-green translucent crystal, these poor souls are living on a timer, they know they will likely soon die. Many of these individuals received their first major dose by accident, as the drug is very commonplace here. Work is being done to eradicate it, but it is difficult.

#### Vaxia (Drug)
Vaxia is a crystal that grows on the plant *Vorns Vaxialis*, like a flower would grow on other plants. The plant is incredibly voracious, and grows pretty much anywhere, reproducing by runners. Unfortunately for Abrasos, it is definitely not contained, and is often seen as a weed in grass, gardens, and even in cracks in the sidewalk. 

If taken in small, dilute amounts (< 0.01 milligram), it can minutely enhance one's own magic, or, more importantly, the magical effects of whatever it was mixed with.

Taking any more results in a similar effect, but with serious side effects. The subject's magical ability is vastly increased, however, their flesh begins to turn into a translucent bluish-green crystal. This begins in the bones, and for some time, can be manageable. The crystal only expands, taking over more of the body, when under the influence of Vaxia. However, once it starts taking over meaty flesh, things become worse. The affected parts of the body can only be moved when under the influence of Vaxia, in which case, they can nearly operate like normal. However, without it, they become dead weights, unable to be moved, and rather painful where they are joined to the flesh. The necessary dose of Vaxia to keep the affected areas usable is by far enough to cause the crystallized area to continue to grow. It usually starts with extremities, the tips of fingers and toes, growing inward.

Once the crystal takes over internal organs, it is all over. The crystal cannot function as an organ, no matter how much Vaxia the afflicted individual is taking. They will die, often painfully. 

Due to the highly dangerous nature of this drug, it is tightly controlled in the larger Empire, and even on this planet. Every vehicle or person leaving is thoroughly examined to find any trace of the drug. Specialized devices have been made to detect its presence.

### Vemmzia
The city of Vemmzia is a port city, set on the cliffs near the norther ice cap, a place of red rocks and red sunsets. It is cold in the winter, warm in the summer, and full of massive flying creatures of many species and types. Some, lizard-like are called wyrms. Others, like insects but twelve feet long, are called vulkani. There is a type that resembled the underwater manta rays found on some worlds called Effiki, and they are tame enough to ride! The city is built on top of the cliffs, but the cliffs themselves make excellent places to build docking spurs and such for large spacecraft to pull into without having dedicated landing towers. 

### Curcevel
At the heart of Curchevel is the intimidating Curchevel Labs, an Imperial research center, civilian staffed and run. Its purpose is to research more about the planet, its magic, and fascinating flora and fauna. Interestingly enough, this is where the first holographic displays were invented, based off of the illusionary effects some species of predators use to hunt their prey. The city around it is mostly in support of the lab, from common things like grocers, vehicle maintenance, and the like to more specialized industries, like custom part fabrication specialists, to local experts offering their services to escort the researchers to their research sites.

### College of Braxion
Located in a smaller town that mostly exists because of the College, the College of Braxion is the foremost school of magical knowledge in the empire. It is exclusively a post-graduate university, and is exclusive in whom it accepts. This does not mean it has a small student body, on the contrary, it is sizable, full of extremely intelligent individuals who have devoted their lives to the furthering of magic and science.

## Turtuv (moon)
The world of Turtuv is a strange one. The planet is surrounded by an intensely strong and chaotic magnetic field, that tends to lock magnetic objects in a series of layers in its atmosphere. The core of the planet is a small sphere of mostly liquid water, though the minerals dissolved in it make it a superconductor, and its endless swirling creates the chaotic magnetic fields. Floating above this core are a number of rocky islands, each rich in the superconductor mineral, that float in place, carried here and there as the magnetic fields change, they ride them like waves. Its not entirely understood why they never get low enough to touch the water, even a ship cannot, strong drives get met with stronger magnetic resistance.

Some animals call the moon their home, and have the same mineral in their bones. They tend to have light and fluffy or otherwise airy bodies, and they "jump" between islands, sometimes for miles, following the magnetic currents. 

There are several privately owned colonies and research stations on the moon, and even a few small farms of the native creatures, but its entirely under Nevvelia in rule.


## Aarvanos
This icy world is the coldest of the inhabitable worlds in the Hathendrome system. It is also almost tidally locked, making things a bit complicated. The planet rotates around its axis twice for each revolution around the star, meaning a single local day is the same length of time as a single local year, or, 0.98 standard years. This has the effect of giving the most extreme seasons of any planet, its summer is wet and hot, with a never-ending sun, but its winter is dark, cold, and silent. All the life on the planet constantly migrates around the globe to stay out of the night, often preferring to be in different bands of twilight or even full summer. Plants grow quickly, and trees simply don't exist as they don't have enough time to grow. All plants reproduce quickly, and most spread using air to transport their seeds, as there is a constant surface-level wind from the dark side to the sunlit side, while the opposite is true in the high atmosphere. 

Aarvanos is the only inhabitable planet in the Hathendrome system without any habitation. Its just too hard, as permanent structures will be destroyed on a yearly cycle.
