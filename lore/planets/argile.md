# Argile

The system of Argile is one of the more well-developed systems, with four inhabited planets, two inhabited moons, and a dozen or more large inhabited space stations. The primary planet, Argile, is one of the five core worlds of the Empire, and the only planet with a heredetary monarchy. 

## Planets of the System
Of the four planets, Avalon is the most populated. The other planets, Maltessa, Grovat, and Vothis-Ur are also highly populated, but not to the same magnitude. The twin moons of Vothis-Ur, Michims and Microvoa, are less densely populated, but still have populations in the billions. All of these planets and moons are considered independent, though, they all also are officially under the guidance of the King of Argile, who only rules the planet of Argile directly. 

### Argile
The planet of Argile has roughly 37.6 billion residents. Much of its surface is covered in large cities, with tall skyscrapers, wide streets, and advertisements for all the largest corporations. 

Many of these corporations choose to make the planet of Argile their home planet, for Argile has one of the most free economies, with barely any government intervention. This free economy has lead to the growth of many of the Empire's most notable companies, like the renowned Datapad manufacturer, Grepit. 

The Crystal Hills is a string of cities on the planet's southern hemisphere, next to the Caspian Sea, known for being the Empire's unofficial center of tech development. The sheer number of startups that have started there is impressive, and what is more so are the success rates. The hills get their names as the birthblace of modern Crystal-based computing, replacing the older silicon-and-electricity systems. 

The Royal Family of Argile have been known to be highly supportive of these efforts, making the planet, and even the system, the most wealthy in the Empire. Not only in terms of GDP, but also in terms of the poor point of the citizens. On average, the poorest citizens have a higher quality of life than the richest in the colonies (such as the Halcion Cluster, Harmony, or Torilia).

### Maltessa
A planet artificially brought into the goldilocks zone, Maltessa has undergone massive terraforming, resulting in a planet teeming with life. However, this life is often thematically at odds with the large, sprawling cities that cover the planet, many of which were originally built before the terraforming was complete. A popultaion of 20.8 billion people live here, in every occupation under the sun.

Many large factories dot the surface, using both air and water for cooling needs. Ships come and go from the many industrial ports carrying raw materials in, and taking manufactured goods out. All those companies that keep their head offices on Argile usually manufacture their product here.

While industry is an essential, and large, part of the populations' lives, there are many other things. Another major industry is the farming of fish, in the plentiful water. 

As mentioned, this planet is wet. Prior to being terraformed, this planet was a dirty ball of ice and snow. Much of that water had to be removed, giving it an uninhabited moon mostly made out of ice that once covered its surface. 

### Grovat
Grovat is a large planet, with fairly strong gravity. People born and raised here tend to be shorter, but strong. With a population of only 12.9 billion, this planet is on the low end for being in a core system. The hostile, hot terrain certainly helps with that, as does the strong gravity. Many industries have found the stronger gravity to be helpful for them, though the shipping and storage industries are not among these. 

The cities and buildings are built underground, to avoid the boiling temperatures on the surface. The hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet's surface was 114 degrees Celsius, well over the boiling point of water.

One of the major industries of Grovat is the mining of Adamantium. Rich adamantium deposits circulate in the planet's upper mantle, and special drills are required to get deep enough to reach it, then break up the ore and bring it to the mine's origin (usually already several hundred feet underground). This is made more difficult by the fact that the heat at that point should cause the rock to be molten, but the pressure keeps it sort of solid (but flexible). Both of these factors make mining difficult.
