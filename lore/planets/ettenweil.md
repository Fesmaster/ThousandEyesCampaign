# Ettenweil
The Ettenweil system is home to two inhabitable planets: Ettenweil and Iuvernia. They are jointly inhabited by Irish Humans and Avarians.

## Planets
The planet of Ettenweil is closer to the star, and is a hot, rocky word. This planet is covered with mines and factories, a real industrial center. It is noted that many secret military projects are done here, as few have any real reason to go to this planet.

Iuvernia, on the other hand, is a practical paradise. The planet has particularly impressive soil, due to a number of active volcanoes and a dynamic weather system. The planet has a lot of agricultural development, and much of this is actually run and managed by humans.

## Ettenweil
The rocky planet of Ettenweil has minimal natural life of its own, and most of it microbial. Its seas are so incredibly briny that it is toxic to all known life. The air contains little oxygen, being mostly nitrogen and a few noble gasses.

This makes the planet a great place for mining and manufacturing. The silicate stone that makes the majority of the planet's surface is a perfect ore for making polysilicate materials. A lot of manufacturing is done here, as it is cheaper to work on a planet that does not have an ecosystem to protect and is closer to the raw materials.

Mining here also focuses on other metals, like Aluminum, Magnesium, Iron, and others. Many trace metals can be crystallized from the salty oceans, being present in surprising concentrations. This includes useful metals like lithium and beryllium. The planet is also a good source of gold, silver and adamantium, essential elements for much of Avarian technology. 

Due to the nature of the planet, it is not exactly a tourist destination. Being so far out of the way from mainstream society, it is an excellent place for the military to build their secret projects. The military shipyards here are.

## Iuvernia
Unlike Ettenweil, Iuvernia is a agricultural world. While there are some cities, the majority of people live in collections of rural establishments all over the planet, farming large tracts of land. The population is nearly evenly split between Avarians and Irish Humans. While there is a disparagy in what jobs can be taken, it is not out of racial sentiments, but out of ability. The humans cannot take part in the government, nor can they work in repairs or manufacturing. Thus, they generally manage and own huge tracts of farmland, or, in the processing business, where the food is put into a form that can travel between stars. This in general makes the successful humans very wealthy.
