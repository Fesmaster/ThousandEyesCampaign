# Ettenweil
The Ettenweil system is home to two inhabitable planets: Ettenweil and Iuvernia. They are jointly inhabited by Irish Humans and Avarians.

## Planets
The planet of [Ettenweil](#ettenweil) is closer to the star, and is a hot, rocky word. This planet is covered with mines and factories, a real industrial center. It is noted that many secret military projects are done here, as few have any real reason to go to this planet.

[Iuvernia](#iuvernia), on the other hand, is a practical paradise. The planet has particularly impressive soil, due to a number of active volcanoes and a dynamic weather system. The planet has a lot of agricultural development, and much of this is actually run and managed by humans. It is orbited by the [Tefalos Space Station](#tefalos-space-station)

## Ettenweil
The rocky planet of Ettenweil has minimal natural life of its own, and most of it microbial. Its seas are so incredibly briny that it is toxic to all known life. The air contains little oxygen, being mostly nitrogen and a few noble gasses.

This makes the planet a great place for mining and manufacturing. The silicate stone that makes the majority of the planet's surface is a perfect ore for making polysilicate materials. A lot of manufacturing is done here, as it is cheaper to work on a planet that does not have an ecosystem to protect and is closer to the raw materials.

Mining here also focuses on other metals, like Aluminum, Magnesium, Iron, and others. Many trace metals can be crystallized from the salty oceans, being present in surprising concentrations. This includes useful metals like lithium and beryllium. The planet is also a good source of gold, silver and adamantium, essential elements for much of Avarian technology. 

Due to the nature of the planet, it is not exactly a tourist destination. Being so far out of the way from mainstream society, it is an excellent place for the military to build their secret projects. The military shipyards here are.

Ettenweil is not considered an independant planet, and falls under direct Imperial Law. It does not have its own government.

Unlike Ettenweil, Iuvernia is a agricultural world. While there are some cities, the majority of people live in collections of rural establishments all over the planet, farming large tracts of land. The population is nearly evenly split between Avarians and Irish Humans. While there is a disparagy in what jobs can be taken, it is not out of racial sentiments, but out of ability. The humans cannot take part in the government, nor can they work in repairs or manufacturing. Thus, they generally manage and own huge tracts of farmland, or, in the processing business, where the food is put into a form that can travel between stars. This in general makes the successful humans very wealthy.

### Climate and Geography
Iuvernia sits further from its host star than Earth, making it significantly cooler. The hottest temperature recorded on the planet was around 94 degrees Fahrenheit. This results in larger-than-normal ice caps on the planet. 

The planet has several large oceans, covering nearly 75% or its surface. (counting the oceanic ice caps) This extra thermal mass stabilizes the planet's temperature, allowing the middle band to rarely drop too cold, the coldest recorded temperature is -3 degrees Fahrenheit. It is rare, though, for the temperature to drop below 10 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The non-frozen land areas of the planet are broken into large areas, often called counties, by the mountain ranges. While these mountains are small, particularly for other planets, they are rocky and formidable to those wishing to cross. Large storms build in them, and come sweeping across the lowlands. Many of these mountains lie on natural faults, giving them a decent amount of volcanic activity. While such explosions are surprising, and locally destructive, the ash they produce flows out into the lowlands with the rivers, providing a natural fertilizer, and allowing the lowlands of the counties to be extremely fertile.

Due to a short orbital period (18 hours), the weather on Iuvernia can be rather violent. Storms are strong, and the floods are worse. However, the cities and structures here are designed to deal with it. A large satalite system is used to monitor and predict the weather on a planetary scale, warning cities and people when a bad storm is incoming.

### Flora
Many species of plants are native to Iuvernia, from Sweet vernal grass (*Anthoxanthum odoratum*) to bilberry (*Vaccinium myrtillus*) and crowberry (*Empetrum nigrum*), both of which are highly cultivated. 

Much of the lowlands, that is, the counties, is farmland. The practice of farming here grows several crops on the same field, in such a way that they are mutually beneficial to each other, both providing nutrients and keeping away pests. Numerous grasses have been cultivated to make cereal grains, and a number of tubers (including Potatos (*Solanum tuberosum*), carrots (*Daucus carota sativus*), and garlic (*Allium sativum*)) Other plants, including many varity of fruit plants and trees have been domesticated.

### Fauna
The high oxygen content of this planet makes it ideal for a number of rare species, like the Giant Honeybee (*Apis giganticus*). These massive insects grow to be nearly five inches long.

Other species, including the Irish elk (*Megaloceros giganteus*) live here, and are domesticated. 

### Cities

> City of Dubbran on Iuvernia

The cities of Iuvernia were build originally by the Avarians, though, now, the touches and changes by the Humans can be seen. These cities and usually get all their power from solar power. The cities are usually the homes of most of the residents, even the fieldworkers. The fieldworkers then go out to the fields each day, which are in the surrounding areas.

Due to the aforementioned bad weather and flooding, cities  are usually build on a raised bit of land, and often surrounded with a wall, simply to keep flood waters out. These same walls, if build correctly, could also project a field over the city slowing wind speeds inside, meaning that buildings could be build without a lot of extra reinforcements. 

### Human Inhabitants
The humans of Iuvernia are entirely of Irish decent (with a handful having some Greek lineage due to the Greek attitude to female slaves). They are a interesting lot, known for being hard working, skilled at crafts, but more skilled at song. If any group of people was known for singing and music, it was the Iuvernian Irish. 

The humans population of Iuvernia is estimated to be around three billion people at the current time. This rate has been growing very quickly, and it is estimated that they will quickly become the dominant intelligent species of the planet. They own over three-fourths of the farmland (actually, 85% of the farmland), and around half of the comercial businesses based on Iuvernia.

#### Culture, Dress, and Arts
The Irish struggle to hold onto their culture. They finally have a planet that they can live on pceacefully, and their neighbors to not want to snuff them out. However, as all peaceful civilizations go, times of peace bread lazy folk, and many have given up their heratage and started to live more like their Avarian neighbors. 

The others, however, stick to the old ways, as much as they can. They developed the Tartan very early, using it as a signal of which county one was from. The only material that they use to make their tartans is the naturally grown nettle fiber that they brought with them from Earth five hundred or so years before. Shirts were often tight-fitting across the chest. The arms, however, could be either tight or loose. Loose (particularly with fancy embroidery) is a sign of status, particularly that you did not have to work. Either way, the shirts for both men and women often had "bat wings", or, loose underarm structure. This was considered stylish, along with the loose sleeves, by the well-to-do, as well as practical and breathable by the working class. In general, the more colorful and loose the clothing, the richer the wearer. Tartans were not worn every day, usually it was reserved for a "sunday best". 

Tattoos were a large part of the Irish culture. Often on the face, arms, and hands, these were a sign of rank and of deeds. Thus, while a nobleman might have many, a peasant farmer would have few. Soldiers had unique ones for acts of bravery, and mothers often had one for each child they bore. 

The Irish were a generally happy, jolly race. Their parts of the city were known for good taverans and good night life, as well as the best of parties. There were many reasons to celebrate: a good harvest, the birth or death of someone in the community, weekly religious days, and solem festivals.

The Irish were the most advanced race in terms of musical instruments. They had perfected a great number, from the Fiddle to the Harp, to the Hammered and Plucked Dulcimer, and the Uilleann Pipes (A type of bagpipe). Irish music was well known thought the Empire, and there were many Irish musicians and singers. 

Irish crafts and metalworking were extremely valued, and thus extremely expensive, being collector's items for the rich of many species through the Empire. While it took them significantly more time to make a single piece that the least skilled Avarian craftsman, their work was done by hand, with minimal magic at all.

#### Religion and Philosophy
Many of the Irish who came to Terra were Catholics. At least one Bible made it across, and by this point has been widely reproduced. The Irish people, at least those who care, do their best to carry on the beliefs of their ancestors, though they have not had access to a priest for many hundreds of years. 

The religious leaders of the community are called Magi. Their job is to maintain the religous beliefs and practices. They usually came from noble families, though, they were supported by the community. They maintained the practices, were in charge of education and rituals, and were the ones to read from the Bible each Sunday.

Irish philosophy has blossomed, and they have had many great thinkers. Many books written by the Irish are standard parts of the Avarian Philosophy Collection (a collection of the greatest thoughts in the Empire). Also found in this collection is the Bible. 

#### Technology
The Irish have free access to Avarian technology on Iuvernia, there are no restrictions on their obtaining it (unlike Terra). However, they do develop things on their own.

One notible example is instruments and related technology. Irish brassmaking is far more refined than most other races, as they need fine brass for some of their instruments. 

In other forms, though, the Irish develop many things that are important to them. One such thing they are working to build themselves are spacecraft. This particular development is not widely known outside of those working on it. It is certain that few, if any, Avarains know of the project, mainly so they don't interfere. The work is getting close to the testing phase, specialized thrusters are already operational, it is just waiting for some better computer guidance systems to be finished.

Irish inginuity is also responsible for many of the food and natural products enjoyed through the Empire, including nettle and hemp fiber, as well as a form of natural silk. Their work in domesticating plants and animals is a great contribution to society. 

#### Buisness and Work
There are many areas that the Irish humans of Iuvernia often work in. One of the largest is, unsurprisingly, farming. The humans are both landowners and down-to-earth farm workers. The landowners are generally very rich, and hire others to farm their land. 

Another common area is in transport and mercantile buisness. Many Irish work on the ships that transport goods to and from Iuvernia, as well as running shops and stores on the planet. Over ninety percent of all trade on the planet passes through companies owned and operated by humans. 

Humans also work as guardsmen for both transport ships as well as on the planet itself. Being an agricultural world, pirates often come, seeking soft targets. They are often successful. Thus, more and more planetary militia have been made, and more and more residents armed with real weapons, not their skinny sock knives (Sgain dhu, or, "skin doo").

Still others make their money by investing in the works of others, be that a shipment of tools and equipment to be ordered and resold locally, or a long term contract to ship a new type of beet to [Atlantis](atlantis.html).

### Tefalos Space Station
Orbiting Iuvernia is the Tefalos Space Station, a important docking place for most ships. Large transport vessels do not enter the atmosphere (it would cause shock waves) but instead dock here, and cargo is brought between the station and the Iuvernia proper via smaller shuttle craft. The station boasts a standard labor force of about 1500 individuals, being about two thirds Avarain and one third Human.
