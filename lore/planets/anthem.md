# Anthem

The planets of Anthem are known for their dense populations, the highest outside of the five core worlds. The three inhabited planets, Anthem, Tyrion, and Phalantis, each have populations in excess of 20 billion individuals. The system is also home to several large orbital stations of varying purpose, from low-gravity farming to ship manufacturing. 

## Planets of the System
There are three inhabited planets, two of which were artificially moved into the goldilocks zone of the host star. These three planets are Anthem, Tyrion, and Phalantis. 

### Anthem
The planet of Anthem is the oldest of the planets in the system, and the only to naturally support live. It was once a very diverse planet, but its natural resources have long since been used, and its natural wonders have been placed into protective parks. There are a number of large cities on the planet, for it is home to approximately 23.7 billion individuals. Industry and business of every kind can be found on Anthem, from factories for clothing, to Mom-and-Pop baked goods shops. The planet requires constant maintenance, and there are numerous large industrial buildings entirely devoted to atmospheric maintenance, keeping the gas balance correct and preventing runaway greenhouse effects.

The cities of Anthem, in no particular order, include:
* Habiman City [hab-i-mahn]
* New Ceatoris [cree-ah-tor-is]
* Thameshold [tames-hold]
* Jamidal [Jam-i-dal]
* Veldoon [Vel-doon]
* Mefis [meph-is]

### Tyrion
Tyrion is only slightly smaller than Anthem, being home to around 22.3 billion individuals. Its planet originally was far to cold to have any real ecosystem, and thus all life there is artificially brought. However, as various plants and animals adapted to life on that planet, many unique breeds began to develop. Like Anthem, its atmosphere is artificially maintained, as without that, it would heat up very quickly due to rising carbon dioxide levels. 

The planet of Tyrion is known for its rather famous spaceport, the so-called "Dullian Spaceport", named after the city it is found in, the metropolis called Dullian. The spaceport has the highest number of docking bays of any single spaceport in the empire, for it is the only real place to dock in that city, or at least legally. It makes up for this by being one of the most well-kept spaceports in the empire, being notes for its cleanliness, ease of navigation, and good security. Both public and private flights all move through this port, and it has nearly fourteen thousand flights each day, leaving or coming.

### Phalantis
Phalantis is the smallest of the inhabited worlds in the Anthem system, being home to 20.4 billion individuals. Like Anthem and Tyrion before, there is no major industry of Phalantis, all are present in nearly equal amounts. Indeed, Phalantis is known for being one of the most free economies in the empire, and nearly every major cooperation has at least one office here, if not their head office. The market centers of Phalantis are one of the best places to buy and sell shares, stocks, bonds, or even raw materials. Indirectly, of course. In recent years, Phalantis has become one of the largest sites for credit-transfer validation. 

Anyone visiting Phalantis is advised to go see the Golden Palace, the seat of government on Phalantis. It is located in Urbanbu, the capitol city, and impossible to miss. It is a marvel of engineering, and very beautiful. It can be a bit distracting to fly over, but this is not recommended, due to that airspace being restricted. 

### Uninhabited planets
A number of gas giants also share the system, though there are no other rocky bodies. Even the moons of the gas giants have been mined to nothing. One gas giant, Gremorion, is actively being mined for its rich hydrogen content, for the use in decarbonizing the atmospheres of the three inhabited planets in the system, as well as other planets though the empire.

## Stations and other Places

### Silviac Station
Silviac Station is a large solar station, where a number of low-gravity farms are. It collects sunlight in from large receptors on the sunward side of the station, and filters it before shining it into the many acres of greenhouses and hydroponics bays. Many plants too delicate for growth on planets are grown here, and its outputs are shipped all over the empire.
