# Sparta

|[Planets](#planets-of-the-system)|[Peoples](#people-of-sparta)|

The Sparta System holds the forward operations center for the Avarian Spaceforce in their standoff with the Grenier. It is home to one inhabitable planet, Sparta, as well as several rocky worlds not natrually inhabitable, though, not ignored. It also hosts a large number of permanent space stations, as well as numerous capitol ships at any given point.

## Planets of the System

The planets of the Sparta System, in order of distance from the star, are [Kovon](#korvon), [Harblest](#harblest), [Sparta](#sparta-1), [Inkla](#inkla), [Bregos](#bregos) and [Volutus](#volutus). The closest four are rocky planets, with Sparta lying in the goldilocks zone, and naturally harboring life. All four are inhabited, though, the other three are not independant, some areas being military bases, others being settlements under the authority of the Planet of Sparta. The other two, however, are large gas giants that lie in the outer regions of the system. 

In between Sparta in Inkla, and, to some degree, surrounding Inkla, is a large asteroid field that makes a donut shape around the star, a thick orbital patern. Inkla itself is surrounded by asteroids, many of which orbit Inkla.

### Korvon
The hot rocky workd of Korvon is the closest to the star, and bakes at an intense heat. While too hot for liquid water on the surface, it is not so hot as that living there is impossible. A settlement, or, more accurately, permanent military training camp, operates out of this world, to train soldiers to work in adverse conditions. This camp is often called "Hades" by the Greeks who run and attend the camp. Hades is leagally under the authority of the Planet Sparta.

Over Korvon is a satellite array, like all the other planets in the system, capable of firing upon any invading ships. 

### Harblest
The less hot world of Harblest is able to support liquid water at night, but just barely. And only during the winter. This does not stop it from having three settlements though. All three are under the surface of the planet, where the cooling systems need to do much less work. 

The first settlement is Delos, and it is primarily a weapons research, development, and storage location. It is said that Delos has the most nuclear weapons of any military base. With an arsenal of over forty thousand thermonuclear warheads, security at Delos is no joke. It is an Avarian-only colony, and manned only by cleared military personnel. 

The second settlement is Nelis, a joint operation between the Avarian Spaceforce and the Greater Spartan Warriors. Its purpose is a deep cover secure strike location in the case that the system is taken by the Grenier. The settlement is always manned, though, it is cleverly hidden in a place most lifesign scanners will not be able to detect. It is equiped to send strike forces out from behind enemy lines if the system is conquered. 

The third settlement is the mining colony of Tartaria. (Little Tartarus) It is mostly manned and operated by the Spartans, and its purpose is mining Harblest for the rich deposits of Adamantium found in its lower crust. This is by far the largest of the settlements, boasting around a thousand inhabitants. The mines here provide Adamantium all through the Empire.

Nelis and Delos are directly under the authority of the Avarian Spaceforce, while Tartaria is under the autority of the Planet of Sparta.

#### Satellites of Harblest
The satellite defense system is also present over Harblest, as well as two manned space stations, the Infinity and the Veridis. Both are Avarian Spaceforce military stations. 

Veridis is a Hospital, and is mostly empty these days, which is a good thing. Though, nearly seven eights of its patients are Spartans. 

Infinity is a Service Station, capable of having four capitol ships parked at it undergoing repairs at once. It is unfortunately often busy, as both the Daedalus Class Battleships and the Valkyrie Class Cruisers are starting to age, and need frequent repairs. 

### Sparta
The heavily populated planet of Sparta is no place to go for a vacation. Outsiders say that the planet is covered in slums, though this is not true. The humans of Sparta, that is, the Spartans, live simply, by choice. There is little in the ways of bells and whistles here, just simple, functional living.

Almost all cities and buildings are built to be defensible. This is due to the militaristic nature of the population. Buildings are often low, solid affairs, made with thick walls that can withstand gunfire. Towers are not common, as they are a good invitation to attack with large cannon and, when falling, can damage surrounding buildings. However, natural mountains and hills are used to gain height advantage, many buildings built on or into the sides of such natural formations.

The population of Sparta is almost eighty percent human, with around fifteen percent Avarian, and the remaining five percent various other species. Telwar Assassins have a distinct presence here, with various Crantiel and Gruudfa also around. War is a big buisness. 

#### Satellites of Sparta
Sparta features a large array of defensive satellites, more so than any other planet in the system. There are also three major space stations, all owned and operated by the Avarian Spaceforce

The first, and oldest, is Apalos. Apalos is a defensive station, and has a massive MAP gun that the station is built around. It cannot dock capitol ships, but it does not need to. It sits in a high orbit, so that it has more time to aim and fire at a target.

The second is Custer Station, or, as it is more commonly known, Starfleet Forward Command. This is the second-highest office for the Avarian Spaceforce, second only to Starfleet Command back on Avalon. This station is designed with a subspace drive so that, if necessary, it can relocate itself to a different system with ease, no tugship needed. 

The third is the mysterious Dark Winter Station. There is little known about this station, including its exact orbital pattern. Some say it performs deep space reconnaissance on the Grenier, while others claim it is a deep science lab. Few are allowed onto it, even if they can find it.

### Inkla
Inkla is a strange world, too cold for liquid water, but warmer than it should be. It has an atmosphere high in methane and carbon dioxide. It has several colonies, some are military training camps, for cold conditions, while others are mining camps, gathering the planet's naturally occuring compounds. Sulfer materials are gathered here, as well as hydrogcarbons. The Avarian Empire has only recently begun exploring the use of artificial hydrocarbon polymers to suppliment their silicon polymers.

One of the interesting things about Inkla is its ability to be constantly bombarded by meteorites. If it was not for this constant bombardment, it would be much, much colder, and the methane in the atmosphere would precipitate out. The longest record time of no meteorite strikes is seventeen hours. The highest frequency of strikes was when twelve hit within five minutes of each other.

Due to this, there are no satellites around Inkla. Any would swiftly be destroyed. Even flying to the planet is dangerous. However, Inkla does have at least fifty signficantly-sized moons (moons move than 100 meters in diameter), and an innumerable number of smaller ones.

### Bregos
A large gas giant with majestic rings, Bregos has many natural moons, and two artificial satellites. The first is the agricultural Tor Station, a completely civilian operation that grows massive amounts of food. It is located here due to the stability of the orbit and less frequent maneuvers due to high ship traffic around the rocky planets.

Second, there is the military satellite of Jackson Station. Jackson station is a general-purpose military station.

### Volutus
Even larger than Bregos, Volutus is a massive planet. It had a number of moons and small, thin rings, but no artificial satellites.


## People of Sparta
In the system, the predominatnt race are Humans. They make up over eighty percent of the population. Another eighteen percent is Avanrains, and the final two percent are various other races, including Telwar, Crantiel, and Gruudfa.

### Spartans
The humans of Sparta, that is, the Spartans, come from Terra, and before that, the Spartan Penesula of Ancient Greece. They have changed much in that time, but also changed little. They have maintained their warrior culture, though, many other aspects of it have changed. They have fully embraced Avarian technology, and use it daily. They maintain a body of rules that only apply to them, not under the supervision of the Avarian government of Sparta. They also maintain the Greater Spartan Warriors, a standing army of Spartans. This army works hand in hand with the Avarian Spaceforce.

#### Home Life
Work is little different from logistics. Everything is kept "running". It is a culture of duty, of responcibility. Labor is often assigned, though they can apply for specific ones they want. The spartan government is one of the largest employers. 

#### Spartan Law
Under Spartan Law, all children, male and female, begin military training at the local academy at the age of twelve. They continue there, both training body in military drills and mind in studies and learning, until the age of twenty. Then, they have a choice. They can return to civilian life, on the condition of a possible draft, or they can apply to the Greater Spartan Warriors. So many apply each year that more than half have to be rejected, simply because if all were accepted, then the non-military functions of society would shut down. Some are accepted into a reserves unit. 

#### Greater Spartan Warriors
The Greater Spartan Warriors is a complex military. Internally, they consider themselves the military of the Spartan nation and people, externally, they are a particularly large mercinary group. They have full ranks, and everything expected from a military. They have a long-term contract with the Avarian Spaceforce, and activly work with them on many missions.

The general role of the Greater Spartan Warriors is to perform military missions deemed too risky for the Avarian forces, due to the nesecity of actual sentient people and high risks.

### Avarians
The majority of Avarians on Sparta are there for military purposes, either directly involved, or part of the support effort. Many have chosen to live here, close to the front, as there is always much to do. Some moved here to be nearer to loved ones, others for oppertunity. They come from all over the Empire driven by various causes and needs.
