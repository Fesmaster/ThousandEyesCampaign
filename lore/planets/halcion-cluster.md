# Halcion Cluster

The Halcion Cluster is a series of three stars that all distantly orbit their own center of gravity, meaning, they seem to chase each other in a very large circle. They each have their own independent planetary planes, as well as share some small plantoids that swap between them. The three stars are called Igaros, Etenos, and Spekelos. 

## Planets of The Halcion Cluster
There are a large number of planets, large and small, in this cluster. Seven of them are able to natively host life. All of these planets are either unpopulated or are colonies. This part of the Empire is not yet highly developed. 

### Meridia
The planet of Meridia orbits Etenos, and hosts a Terran-like ecosystem. A rich, green planet, with abundant water and foliage, it is being colonized for major agricultural growth. The colonies here are mostly Avarian in name, but are almost entirely populated by Iuvernian Humans. 

Meridia is considered an independent planet. Several distinct colonies exist on the planet. 

### Torson
The most settled planet of the cluster, Torson is just on the edge of being considered a colony. Here the local Avarian government sits, including a local military force that deals with any interplanetary incidents. 

The planet hosts a single medium-sized city, Telmacta, and several smaller colonies. The planet was originally colonized for abundant natural resources, including good sources of silicon dioxide (quartz sand). However, other resources were discovered, including a number of natural animals that could be easily domesticated and farmed. Lithium and Magnesium salts were discovered in abundance in its oceans, allowing for their extraction. Further, the slightly arid nature of the planet made it an excellent open space for building, and thus it was one of the first settled. Now, it has a number of manufacturies that serve the rest of the cluster and the Empire at large. 

### Vectel
A young, rocky world, most of the life on Vectel consists of mosses and lichen. There is little erosion, due to the planet being relatively young, only having liquid water for about 260 years. When it was first discovered, its orbit was more erratic than any other planet, but, its orbit has slowly been correcting itself, due to near passes with other planets and stars. Several collisions with ice asteroids helped the process, and brought water to the planet. 

Vectel has several mining colonies, for materials such as Beryllium, Cobalt, Iron, Graphite, and a number of other minerals. It is considered a dependent planet under Torson.

### Talpos
Of all the colonies, Talpos is almost exclusively settled by Telwar. While it is not as much of a jungle as their homeworld, its thick vegetation is similar. They are the only ones who feel at home in such an environment, let alone have the skills to develop it. 

Interesting materials found here are the plants. Many have been already cultivated to produce raw materials for both the Telwar and the Empire. One of interesting note is a plant that is capable of refining Adamantium from the soil. Research into making this plant viable economically and maximizing its output is ongoing. Other plants include those that make strong resins and silicates, as well as complex carbon-based molecules.

### Omeria
Omeria's surface is over 85% water. While the oceans are vast, they are not very deep. A lot of manufacturing has settled here due to the massive water supply for cooling machinery. With no moon, the tides on this planet are minimal at best, the water rising and falling a distance of a few inches at most. 

### Nimradan
The sister planet to Omeria, Nimradan is very, very dry. It orbits a bit closer to its star. However, it is host to several colonies, due to the large amount of fine sand and clay that can be processed into the silica polymers used by most manufacturing in the Empire. This planet is swiftly becoming the largest supplier of silica-based raw materials in the Empire. One great benefit to this planet is that there is little life to disrupt. Most life is based near the poles, where water is more common and the temperatures are cooler, while the mines are nearer the equator, where it is hot, dry, and dead. 

### Glavanta
Galvanta is classified as a large rocky planet. Its gravity is nearly double that of Avalon or Terra, or most other rocky worlds. It contains a high-oxygen atmosphere (84%), making some more sensitive species need special air to breathe, due to oxidation of their lungs. Some more volatile materials also must be stored in special containers, due to spontaneous combustion. This high oxygen content is due to the vast, vast amount of greenery on the planet. There is a duality of life here, while the surface and seas are full of carbon-based life, underground there are silicon-based microorganisms. These organisms "eat" silica oxide (sand) and water, then, under heat, convert it to more complex silica materials, as well as oxygen gas. There is a large colony here, dedicated to researching this to increase the efficiency of silica polymer manufacturing in the empire.
