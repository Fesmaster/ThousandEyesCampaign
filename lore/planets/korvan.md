# Korvan
A distant and lawless system, Korvan is known for being a pirate haven. The presence of the Empire here is low, due to this system being considered low value. There are a few systems, none very plesant.


## Korvan
Korvan is the only habitable planet in the system. Nicknamed "The Dustbowl", Korvan does not have any naturally occuring water. All water now on the planet was brought there by travelers. In the early days, this was done by finding icy meteorites and sending them down in special ships. 
The only reason anyone lives here is Mithril. As the rarest, yet most essential, of commodities, mithril mining is an essential industry. Korvan is the last planet with any known reserves of this rare metal. All other sources, of which there were few, have been picked clean. It is the second planet that is known to have ever housed the metal naturally, the first being a small planet in the [Avalon System](avalon.html) that was mined so much it simply does not exist as a planet anymore. 

### Mithril Mining
Mithril mining takes place on the salt flats in the southern part of the planet. Imported water is used to dissolve salts, which is then chemically treated to percipitate out base metal salts, like sodium, magnesium, or lithium salts. The remaining solution is held at specific temperatures and concentration (via evaporation) to control which remaining mineral crystalizes. These are then collected, going either to the waste heap, or, if the mithril salt, to further refinement and conversion to mithril carbonate for transport off-world. 

### People of Korvan
No one is on Korvan by choice. For some, they are exiled there. For others, it was the only place they could get work. For yet others, it was the lure of the unknown that drew them, and the stark conditions that trapped them. A mixture of Avarians, Humans, and Gruudfa populate the planet, leaving it diverse in species, but close in intent. A struggle to survive anywhere, most happily get along and help each other.

## Mazarine
Mazarine is a dangerous world. Its atmosphere is made up of sulfur gases, and highly corrosive. But worse, wind speeds range from 50 to 300 MPH on the surface. This is worsened by the atmosphere being incredibly dense, having 102.8 PSI (7 atmospheres) of pressure at the surface. Further, a band of microwave radiation exists in the upper atmosphere, making it very difficult to even get a ship close enough for the wind and corrosive atmosphere to matter. However, protected by this impenetrable fortress, the planet is rich in gold, platinum, and other materials that do not corrode, including many types of gemstones. Anything else would have been eaten away and joined the atmosphere long ago. 

## Smargdine
Above Mazarine orbits Smargdine, a space station constructed and manned by pirates and other criminal types. The station is slowly assembled from battered ships being permanently welded into place, transport containers attached, and any other container capable of handling the pressure, Smargdine is a venerable maze of corridors, chambers, and large open areas. At its core lies an abandoned Avarian research station, built and left behind when the Empire first explored the system. Since then, many large ships have been added, and brining a large ship to add is a guaranteed way to become popular and rich in the pirate community. 

### Construction of Smargdine
Whenever a new piece is added permanently, a special ceremony is done. One of the Seven Pirate Lords conducts the ceremony. First, the keys to the attached ship or container, if any, and ceremoniously passed from the previous owner to the Pirate Lord. the Lord then unlocks all the doors on the new compartment, and confirms it is airtight. He then takes a welding torch and helmet and ceremoniously welds the key inbetween the ship and the rest of the station, binding the two together with the metal of the key. Over that spot, the places a Seal of Smargdine, a metal plate with a symbol of Smargdine, and welds that symbol in place, claiming the newly attached chamber as part of the station. Then, the Pirate Lord, the previous owner, and all  who attend, throw a big party with lots of drinking, and maybe a Smarmy Dive or two. 

### Upkeep and Maintenance
A mysterious fleet of drones with green-flame thrusters and weapons, and even shimmering green force fields, both maintain the station and gather materials for it. No one knows how they are controlled, but they are treated as the personal servants of the Pirate Lords. 

### Leadership of Smargdine
Smargdine is ruled by Seven Pirate Lords. The Lords themselves change often (death, dismemberment, disappearance) and are identified by an item they are given by the previous Lord, namely, a necklace, made from gold, each with a unique gemstone set in it. The necklace is charmed so it must be given in the true faith that the successor is worthy of being a Pirate Lord. There may be an Eighth Lord, but he exists in rumor and legend. Everyone is torn whether it’s a real guy or an honorary position.

### Smarmy Diving
Smarmy Diving is a sport unique to Smargdine. It consists of an ongoing competition to be the first to build a robot to reach the surface of Mazarine, gather some riches, and return. As of yet, none have ever accomplished this feat, though many have tried. The best record is a robot (Athánatos periplanómenos III (Immortal Wanderer)) that managed to make it within 100 ft of touchdown before its systems failed and contact was lost.

## Revel
Revel is often considered to be Hell. The planet is not a nice one, close to its star, the majority of its surface is molten. Underneath that surface, however, is where it gets worse. Carved out in the dimeritium-rich rock or the planet is a jail, not for mortals, but for celestials. Here are trapped the devious, dangerous celestials that have been sentenced to an eternity imprisoned by the Empire. 

To help protect the planet, it is surrounded by several defenses. One is an automated satellite cloud that will disintegrate approaching ships. Another is a strong anti-mass force field that blocks anything physical from entering the atmosphere. What other defenses there may be are unknown. It is not recommended to approach.
