# Terra
A simple planet covered in a wide array of terrains and lands, Terra is best known for being the homeworld of the Humans.

## Planets in the System
The Terra system is a small star system, only having three planets. There is a far-flung ice planet on an irregular orbit called [Odissi](#odissi), a large gas giant called [Cronovs](#cronovos), and [Terra](#terra) itself. However, there are large numbers of asteroids in orbit, mostly further out than Terra.

## Odissi
Covered in primordial ice, this small world has seen some importance as a forward operation base for asteroid mining. It makes a good location for this as water is plentiful.

## Cronovos
Cronovos is home to the fabled Ganymede Space Station, home to over a thousand Avarian citizens. This station is primarily a civilian research base, as Cronovos contains a few mysterious substances that the Avarians want to study and, if possible, use. 

## Terra
Terra is the destination of many mysterious one-way portals. It is through these that humans come. They have opened at several points in history, each time bringing different types of people through. 


### Inhabitants
The first group that came through were Ancient Greeks from the [Archaic Period](https://www.ancient.eu/Archaic_Period/), being between 800 and 500 BC. This is during the time Homer was writing the Iliad and the Odyssey. It is not surprising, then, that they named the two other planetary bodies in their system after Cronus and Odysseus. 

The second major group that came through were from Ireland from around the year 550 AD. This is before the majority of English influence and oppression, which began in earnest in the 1100's AD, with King Henry II of England. This, however, does not mean that they were not oppressed. The Greek decendants (who had a thousand years or more to grow in numbers) were suspicious and openly hostile to the newcomers, and often took them as slaves. This became such an issue that the Avarian Empire interfered, and relocated the majority of the Irish descendants to the [Ettenweil](ettenweil.html) System. However, this was only after a few generations of slavery and oppression, as the Greeks were particularly good at hiding it, and the Avarian presence on Terra is minimal at best.

The third major group to come was the Samurai of Japan. This one happened in a slightly different way than the previous. A large island was transported from Earth to Terra, bringing along with it the several villages that were on it. These were ruled by the Samurai, and were often considered places for a Samurai to go and train with the experts. Aproxamately half the the island's population were Samurai.

The Samurai and the Greek Inhabitants did not get along very well. However, as an island appearing drew the attention of the local Avarian government, the Samurai were not enslaved. Only time will tell how this clash plays out, as the Samurai Island only arrived around a hundred and three years prior to the current date.
