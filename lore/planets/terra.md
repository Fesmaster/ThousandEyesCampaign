# Terra
A simple planet covered in a wide array of terrains and lands, Terra is best known for being the homeworld of the Humans.

## Planets in the System
The Terra system is a small star system, only having three planets. There is a far-flung ice planet on an irregular orbit called [Odissi](#odissi), a large gas giant called [Cronovs](#cronovos), and [Terra](#terra) itself. However, there are large numbers of asteroids in orbit, mostly further out than Terra.

## Odissi
Covered in primordial ice, this small world has seen some importance as a forward operation base for asteroid mining. It makes a good location for this as water is plentiful.

## Cronovos
Cronovos is home to the fabled Ganymede Space Station, home to over a thousand Avarian citizens. This station is primarily a civilian research base, as Cronovos contains a few mysterious substances that the Avarians want to study and, if possible, use. This station is known for having invented much of the current crystal processing technology, and some of the crystals made there still hold imperial records of highest paths per cubic centimeter. (A good measure of processing speed and power)

## Terra
Terra is the destination of many mysterious one-way portals. It is through these that humans come. They have opened at several points in history, each time bringing different types of people through. 


### Inhabitants
The planet of Terra is almost entirely populated by Humans. The current population is estimated to be in excess of 8 billion.

The first group that came through were Ancient Greeks from the [Archaic Period](https://www.ancient.eu/Archaic_Period/), being between 800 and 500 BC. This is during the time Homer was writing the Iliad and the Odyssey. It is not surprising, then, that they named the two other planetary bodies in their system after Cronus and Odysseus. One group of Greeks left Terra, namely, the Spartans. They went to the [Spara system](sparta.html), where they form a fully human military, operating under mercenary status for the Avarian Space Force. 

The second major group that came through were from Ireland from around the year 550 AD. This is before the majority of English influence and oppression, which began in earnest in the 1100's AD, with King Henry II of England. This, however, does not mean that they were not oppressed. The Greek decendants (who had a thousand years or more to grow in numbers) were suspicious and openly hostile to the newcomers, and often took them as slaves. This became such an issue that the Avarian Empire interfered, and relocated the majority of the Irish descendants to the [Ettenweil](ettenweil.html) System. However, this was only after a few generations of slavery and oppression, as the Greeks were particularly good at hiding it, and the Avarian presence on Terra is minimal at best.

The third major group to come was the Samurai of Japan. This one happened in a slightly different way than the previous. A large island was transported from Earth to Terra, bringing along with it the several villages that were on it. These were ruled by the Samurai, and were often considered places for a Samurai to go and train with the experts. Aproxamately half the the island's population were Samurai.

The Samurai and the Greek Inhabitants did not get along very well. However, as an island appearing drew the attention of the local Avarian government, the Samurai were not enslaved. Only time will tell how this clash plays out, as the Samurai Island only arrived around a hundred and three years prior to the current date.

#### The Greeks and their Politics
The Greeks dislike "Avarian Interference". They don't mind asking the Avarians to help with something specific, and they don't mind following the Imperial Laws (at least, in public), and they don't mind doing things for the Avarians. What they do mind is the Avarians poking into internal Greek buisness and messing with it.

Terra, as a planet, is not one unified people. There were a number of different countries, and all of these originated from the original Greeks not having been from the same city-states. Most of these countries were named after the city-states that the original inhabitants came from. The largest, and often the most powerful, was the country of Athenas (founded by people from Athens). Other notable countries included Minoa, Ithica, Rhodes, and Attica.

This is not somthing the Avarians understood. In their opinion, these countries were more like small counties in a state, to compare it to the US. However, this is not how the Greeks saw or treated it, they were distinct and seperate countries.

#### Greek Technology
The Greeks were impressively advanced. They had developed to a level of technology that is just within Earth's future. They had invented robotic exoskeletons, and created atomic weapons, and even had a manned space station, reachable by traditional combustion rockets. (Something considered to old for living beings by the Avarians) They had discovered electricity and had invented microprocessors, and had even built quantum computers. 

However, the local Avarian governemnt had put a trade restriction in place: no Greeks of Terra were to obtain Avarian technology. This is because every time they got some, they would try and use it to attack a neighboring country. Thus, they were banned from owning or using any. This just created a healthy black market. 

#### Greeks beyond Terra
Many Greeks left Terra, either legally or illegally. Most of them illegally though. These stole Avarian ships and often became pirates, many of which caused much trouble for the Empire. It is these Pirates that kept bringing Avarian technology to fuel the black markets of Terra. This is, unfortunately, well known in the Empire. However, there is little they can do. Efforts to require all ships that land on Terra have a transponder have been thwarted by modified power control crystals, and similar difficulties present themselves at every turn. 

#### Avarians and Terra
There are only a small number of Avarains on Terra. They mainly form a figgurehead government, and often have absolutely no power. Interestingly enough, being assigned to this planet is usually a form of political assassination by a higher ranking member of the government who feels threatened, or wants to punish the unlucky official. This is due to the absolutely horrid way the Avarians are treated on Terra. Avarains are called "Lefkós", or *Λευκός*, which translates roughly to "Whitey". It is a slang term for the paleness of their skin.
