# Atlantis
The Atlantis system is one of the five Core Systems of the Empire. In it lies the planet Atlantis, known for being the most beautiful world in the Empire. 

## Planets of Atlantis
The most important planet of the system is the planet Atlantis, a densly populated, yet well cultivated system. It is not, however, the only planet. Its moon, Malvaston, is also populated, though it does not have any atmosphere to speak of. The massive space station of Harbanger also orbits a gas giant in the system, providing one of the largest shipyards in the Empire. Another planet in the system, Zalapa, was long ago moved into the goldilocks zone, and has been a farming planet for a long time. 

## Atlantis
The Shining World of Atlantis has many names. The World of a Thousand Lakes, the Garden of the Empire, and more. It is known for its architecture, its terraforming, its arts. A massive array of satellites keeps the weather on the planet stable an perfect, unless someone wants it to change and pays for it! Lakes dot the surface, often shallow, but clear. This is not due to any natural phenomenon, but the constant care and upkeep used to keep them pristine. Mansions and other grand buildings are common, not grouped densly, but spread out, each with their own plot of land. A number of denser cities exist, but they too are built to be as magnificant as possible. 

Government is located in the city of Raxosis, a large metropolis, with a population of over 16 million people. Many of these are workers whose constant job is upkeep for the more wealthy, who live outside of the city in the many mansions. The population of Atlantis is over 97% Avarian, as few others have the capitol to build of buy a mansion, or the desire and expertise needed to perform the thousand and one upkeep tasks. 

Besides its architecture and natural wonders, Atlantis is known for its artist, its sculptors, it playwriters. Painters and composers from all over flock to the Atlantian Institution of the Arts, the largest school of the arts in the Empire. Memory, they say, is one thing, but true skill can only be developed through years of practice. 

## Malvaston
Orbiting Atlantis is the moon Malvaston. Even though this moon has no atmosphere, it still manages to have a population of over 5 billion. Here people live inside of large, transparent domes, which are full of cultivated landscape, the buildings and residences underneath, forming a underground network of cities and travel spanning the moon. 

Malvaston is governed independently of Atlantis, having a different culture of moderation, stoicism, minimalism, and mathematic perfection, to a degree not seen anywhere else in the Empire. Here it is a crime to have unnecessary decoration, including statues, painting, and music. This rule is not enforced, though many live by it, in a retaliation of the time spent under the rule of Atlantis. The problems between the planet and the moon arose due to rules that Atlantis would make, not taking into account how they would effect an airless moon. (for example, laws regarding every residence to have a certain number of trees or plants) This caused the peope of Malvaston to reject the values of the Atlantian society once they gained independence, and head off in the opposite extreme. 

Malvaston is home to the Tripoli Spaceport, a well known port, often a stopping off point for journeys on the exterior edge of the empire (Exterior related to Galactic center, off the map to the left.) The port is known for being a hub of trade, transport, and bars (frequent breakers of the laws against music). 

## Harbanger
The shipyards of Harbinger are known as one of the largest shipyards in the Empire. Here the Harbinger Corporation manufactures its starships, from small drones to massive freighters. The station is in the shape of a ring, (shaped like a Halo from Halo, but it does not spin), around 5 kilometers in diameter (3.1 miles). The edges are lined with dry docks of various sizes, each nearly always full with a partially constructed starship. In the center of the ring is a large sphere, half a kilometer in diameter, that houses one of the largest power reactors in the Empire, used in the refinement of raw adamantium, mithril, and other materials, for the starships. 

Many have heard of the Harbanger Run, a special space route from Korvan in the Korvan System to Harbanger in the Atlantis System, a route used in the transportation of raw mithril carbonate. 

## Zalapa
Many hundreds of years ago, the planet of Zalapos has a much wider orbit. Then, through great effort, it was moved to a smaller, more stable orbit, in the goldilocks zone. The planet was then terraformed, and is now a large agricultural planet. Much of the surface is perfect for growing cereal grains, used in bread and other common food products. The northern areas are often used for farming large flocks of a type of flightless bird called a *chiroo*, known for its 2:1 calorie efficiency.
