### Power Plant
The Power Plant is the core of any Spacecraft. It generates all the power needed. As ships require lots of power, there are a limited number of ways to generate it. There are three main types of power systems found on ships.

#### Momentum Batteries
Momentum batteries work by having several massive disks, spinning frictionlessly in a vacuum chamber. These are brought up to speed when the ship is landed, from an external power source, and their angular momentum used during flight to generate power. These disks are generally about three to fifteen meters in diameter, and weigh in the range of 1 to 4 tonns. They spin, at full charge, around five hundred thousand rpm. When being used for power, a "brush" extends so that it is near the edge of the disk, which, the two being made of special materials, causes curon energy to build in the arm, while slowing the disk down. 

These Momentum Batteries are not a high power system, they cannot power [Subspace Drives](#subspace-drive), [Hyperdrives](#hyperspace-drive), or high energy weapon systems. They are often seen on smaller ships, often pleasure or personal craft.

#### Metalburners
Metalburner ships use nuclear fire to "burn" low-density metals (like lithium or magnesium), releasing massive ammounts of energy that is easily collected. Lithium-Boron burners are common, as they produce massive ammounts of energy and have oxygen as their waste. (Though the oxygen must undergo treatment to remove latent radiation poisoning before released into the cabin).

These Metalburner power plants are high energy, and common on many ships, and are the defacto type for a small fighter, due to their ease of construction. A Metalburner engine can be as small as 50 centimeters in diameter. However, they are often also found on larger ships, many military-grade carriers use metalburner power plants. Metalburner power plants are capable of powering [Subspace Drives](#subspace-drive) and other high-energy systems.

#### Chaos Engine
The Chaos Engine is a dangerous, but powerful, type of power plant. It essentially uses contained chaos stuff to react and decompose, releasing massive bursts of energy. As the energy output is not regulated, and gets more erratic the more is drawn from it, large and expensive systems are needed to safely buffer the power. 

Chaos Engines are common on military capitol ships, as they have the insanely high power output needed for the shields and weapons of such a large ship. The are an ideal power source for [Subspace Drives](#subspace-drive) and other high-energy systems.

### Life Support
Every ship has at least two life support systems: the Primary Life Support system and the Secondary. Usually, the Secondary is only used in emergency, though, it can be activated if the Primary is under repair. On every ship besides a escape pod, they will certainly both have equal capabilities. Essential functions include: CO2 scrubber, Oxygen Release/Recycling, Toxin and Particle Filtering, Temperature Controls, and Humidity Controls. On life pods, the secondary system usually only has Co2 scrubbing.

### Sublight Thrusters
Sublight Thrusters are used for moving the ship (usually in a straight line forward) under the speed of light. This includes planitary ascent and decent, as well as orbital maneuvers, and combat flying. It is augmented by a [Reaction Control System](#reaction-control-system). Sublight Thrusters burn fuel, sometimes having specialized combustible fuels, but also sometimes using ion engines. Metalburner ships can use special engines that let the power plant heat a single propellant to thrust temperatures, instead of having a combustible propellant pair.

### Reaction Control System
The Reaction Control System is the system used for both turning the ship as well as fine movements. On small ships, like escape pods, turning is entirely done by use of a powerful flyweel, like a gyroscope, and called a reaction control wheel. This is not used on larger ships, as it is simply not strong enough. Instead, two systems are used, one for high speed, one for low speed.

#### Space Locks
Space Locks are how the Reaction Control System works at high speeds. These units essentally "grab" space around them, creating drag, even in a vaccume. This allows fast moving ships to turn or stop on a dime, as if they were in an atmosphere. It is essental for all combat fighter ships, and is also used in large capitol ships.

#### Directional Thrusters
A series of small, directional thrusters cover almost all ships. These are used for fine movement and docking, as well as turning when at low speeds. They are often a monopropellant, using something like liquid nitrogen for liquid helium for their thrust.

### FTL System
The FTL (Faster Than Light) System is the FTL drive of choice and its supporting hardware. There are two primary types of FTL drives with their own advantages and disadvantages.

#### Hyperspace Drive
The hyperspace drive brings the ship into a level of space with a faster speed of light, and launches it at a very high velocity. This is generally the most efficent drive, as it does not require nearly as much as the Subspace drive, and it is signficantly less noisy. It also is more stable. The major drawback is that it is slower. It generally achieves speeds of around 100 to 250 times the speed of light. They also have to follow fixed hyperspace routes to avoid coming too near stars and planets that they can crash into. The energy this drive consumes is a linear function of the distance traveled, with most of the energy being the primary condition, which is constant. Thus, it does not cost significantly more to make a long jump than a short jump.

#### Subspace Drive
The subspace drive opens a wormhole between the ship's location (or, just in front of it) and the destination, and the ship is launched through. This means that, no matter the length of the journey, the time is the same. The energy requirement, however, is not. (unlike the Hyperspace Drive). This drive is also noisy, that is, when it enters or exits subspace, a massive gravitational wave is given off, causing a distinct "pop" sound (actually audible) in any nearby vessel. This is also able to be detected by instruments from a good distance away. It consumes a massive ammount of power, particularly for longer jumps, and requires large capacitors to store it. Thus, two successive jumps cannot be made right after each other. The energy consumed is a factor of the distance cubed, not a linear function.

### Weapon Systems
There are many types of ship weapons, and they serve many roles. Many weapons are spellshots or projected energy weapons, though missiles are common too. Some ships are not armed, such as diplomatic or pleasure vessels, however, most others have basic point defence weapons.

#### Point Defence Turrets
Small caliber turrets on rotating mounts, point defence turrets are primarily used to attempt to shoot nearby attacking fighters. They are specifically designed to fire at fast moving targets, and contain completely internal targeting systems, or can be remote controlled. In many instances, particularly on larger vessels, a whole group can be controlled by a single Gunner. 

#### Cannons
Cannons are generally high-caliber spellshots or energy weapons with limited maneuverability. They are often used in an offensive position, many facing the forward on the ship, though, for larger ships, they also face the lateral sides. Most such cannons are controlled from the Gunner's position on the bridge, or, on single-man fighter ships, the pilot himself. 

#### MAP Guns
Large weapons that often span the length of a capitol ship, MAP guns (Magnetically Accelerated Projectile) are a type of railgun that fire a steel and tungsten rod at about 8% the speed of light (over 23,000,000 meters per second, or 53,000,000 miles per hour). At this speed, the rod (a mere meter in diameter, three long), producing over eleven quintillion (thats an eleven with eighteen zeros) joules of energy. This is fifty-seven times of power larger than that of Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever used (210 PJ for Tsar Bomba, 11,966 PJ for these)

The destructive radius of this weapon, when used against a planet, is around a hundred kilometers for total destruction. (IE, a single one would wipe out New York City.) Some say this is why they are called MAP guns, as, after being fired, the map of the planet permanently changes.

#### Missiles
Most large ships and all fighters contain a battery of missiles. On smaller ships and fighters, these are ACM-tipped, traditional explosive weapons. On larger ships, primarily capitol ships, they are much more dangerous weapons, carrying a thermonuclear payload.

Most, if not all, missiles are designed to be able to follow a specific target, or, they are tracking missiles.


### Shields
Shields are a massively important for spacecraft, military or not. Shields come in several types:
 * Energy-Blocking shields are used to shield the ship from Spellshots and Directed Energy weapons, as well as high-temperatures, like plasma, or high gravity, like a large planet.
 * Matter-Blocking shields are used to shield the ship from physical objects, such as small asteroids and other intersteller medium, as well as hostile missiles and the like.

The two types of shields cannot be operated at the same type. Almost all ships are equiped with a Matter shield, as they are basic safety for a ship. All ships expecting to see combat are equiped with both types, and the equipment to quickly switch types as needed. Shields absorbe damage before it damages the ship, until they run out of power, after which they need to be *cycled*, or, the generators and emitters cooled. This involves cycling cooling fluid though them for several minutes. 

### Navigational Systems
Navigational systems work closely with the [Sensor Arrays](#sensor-arrays) to determine the location of the ship, and plot courses to a destination. This can be as simple as docking to another ship (which is often handled automatically), or as complex as a multi-phase hyperspace jump around the Maw. 

These systems often contain extensive star charts, and often automatically add to them as the various sensors bring more up-to-date information. When two ships get near each other (in a port, for example) and they are both allowed to "share", they exchange updated map data automatically, allowing information to flow freely. This communication is secured, so that it is nearly impossible to use it to send bogus map data and crash a ship, though, it has been done before. However, the benefit of having the latest maps is often outweighed by the potential drawbacks.

### Sensor Arrays
Ships contain various sensor arrays, the magnitude and accuracy of which often directly related to the size of a ship. Sensors include:
 * Optical Sensors (cameras with image processing, and more specialized)
 * Thermal Sensors (infared cameras and the like)
 * Radar (both pining systems and listening systems)
 * Gravitational Sensors (detect small gravity fluctuations)
 * Spectroscopes (filer light spectrum to analyze the materials of a luminescent body)
 * Magnetometers (detect and measure magnetic fields)
 * Particle Detectors (sense microdust particles and analyze contents)
 * Curon (Magic) Field Sensors (Sense the current state and changes in the curon field)

Such sensors feed their raw data to specialized analytic computers that convert the raw data into something meaningful to the pilot (it is one thing to know that there is a slight magnetic pull of starboard bow, and another to know it is a two ton nickle-iron asteroid headed toward you)

### Internal Utilities
Internal utilities include nonessential functions of the ship, such as lights, automatic doors, air fresheners, coffee makers, and the like. Technically, this also includes the artificial gravity systems. It does not include general temperature and humidity, as this is handled by the life support, though it may cover supplemental temperature control, that is, control customizable to a room.
