# Government
The government of the Avarian Empire is a hierarchical, distributed republic. This means that, while there is a central Imperial Government, it does not do much other than manage smaller, more localized sections of the government. This explanation will start on the top and works its way down.

## Citizenship in the Empire
Only Avarians can be Citizens of the Empire, while all races are allowed to be Residents. The difference is quite simple: Citizens are required to hold public office or serve in the military for some portion of their lives, and, in return, get all public services for free. Residents, on the other hand, never hold public office, nor serve in the military, but must pay for public services, like transportation, power, and running water. The reason that this system is used is because the Avarians believe that they are best suited to the burden of leadership, due to their thousands of years of memory, and by virtue of making the Empire to begin with.

## Imperial Government
The Imperial level of Government consists of two distinct parts: the Executors and the Senate. These two work in opposition of each other, and have different types of power.

The Executors are a group of five individuals who hold power over what laws are passed, but are not permitted to write said laws. These positions are hereditary, held in the five Executor Families. Each family comes from a different one of the [Five Core Planets](/). They also serve the position of making decrees during Empire-wide emergencies, though such decrees are limited in their effective time. Further, they serve as an oversight board for the various [Departments](#departments) that make up the majority of the Government's functions

The Senate, on the other hand, is a very large body, with the exact numbers often changing. Generally, there are two senators from each independent planet in the Empire, however, many planets do not send senators, or, for one reason or another, cannot. It is the purpose of the Senate to draft and approve of both Laws and Mandates. Laws are a body of law that effect the entire Empire, they cannot be overruled on a per-planet basis. To pass a new law it takes a majority vote of 90% of the senate, as well as a %100 agreement from the Executors. Mandates, on the other hand, are only binding in exclusively Imperial territory, that is, areas that are not under the governance of a specific planet. This applies to crafts in space, as well as major space stations, and colonies. 

## Departments
While the writing and approving of laws and mandates is good, governments also have a lot of other work to do. This is done by the the various Departments. These departments exist on both the Imperial level as well as the Planetary level, and some, on the local level.

A list of departments and what they do:
 * **Justice Department (JD)** - Prosecuting criminals, but not catching them. Exists in all levels.
 * **Finance Department (FD)** - Responsible for taxes, budgeting, and the like. Exists as seperate entities on all levels.
 * **War Department** - Responsible for the Avarian Spaceforce. Exists only on the Imperial Level.
 * **Criminal Investigative Department (CID)** - Responsible for investigating crimes and other events, and catching criminals. Exists on all levels.
 * **Utilities Department (UD)** - Responsible for public utilities, like roads, power, water, communications, etc. Exists mostly on Local levels, somtimes planitary for more densly populated planets. However, a small Imperial level exists so as to be able to set standards for various things (pipe internal diameters, digital communications standards, etc.)
 * **Industry and Agriculture Department (IAD)** - Responsible for managing land usage rights, (mining included), food quality, industrial development, and many other things related to industrial cooperations. Exists on all levels. 
 * **Medical Deparment (MD)** - Responsible for the standards of medicine and drug production. Exists on all levels, but is strongly Imperial.
 * **Research Department (RD)** - Responsible for a lot of public scientific developments, as well as watching over the scientific community and facilitating the flow of information and new ideas. Exists mostly on Imperial and Planetary levels.
 
## Planetary Governments
Interastingly enough, there is no Imperial Standard for how a planet self-governs. Some, like [Avalon](/), have elections for a representative council, while others, like [Argile](/) rely on a monarchy. On some planets, like [Terra](/), the Avarian government is a small body, that leaves the native population to self-govern in its own way, only being their to maintain Imperial Law and standards, as well as facilitate trade. 

## Local Governments
Local governments, such as of a city, are only common on densly populated worlds with a high percentage of Avarian citizens present. On smaller worlds, there is no need, either because the population is so small or because the population is left to govern itself with some small oversight.
